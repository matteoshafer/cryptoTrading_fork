Like many cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has been tremendously volatile since its inception on July 30, 2015. But apart from the first few months while it was gaining its following, the price has moved higher — tremendously higher — over time. Following years behind Bitcoin and its massive price rise, Ethereum has become the second-largest cryptocurrency by total value.
Ethereum has become one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, noted for its use in “smart contracts” that are self-executed when pre-specified conditions are met. The crypto’s intense price volatility has also made it a popular trading vehicle, helping deft traders make plenty of money, though plenty of them would have done fine holding — or HODLing, as crypto fans say.
Despite the long-term gain, Ethereum has had substantial periods where it’s lost significant value. The price was obliterated in 2018 — losing 82 percent — following a massive run-up the year before when crypto went mainstream. And it didn’t fare so hot in 2022, either, as rising interest rates pummeled risk assets such as cryptocurrency and high-growth stocks.
Ethereum is the brainchild of programmer Vitalik Buterin, who along with others began development on the crypto project in 2014. Ethereum is perhaps best known for its smart contracts, but it also allows users to create and trade non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that are tied to various digital assets such as images and artwork.
While the issuance of Ethereum coins is fixed, there’s literally no limit to the total supply, unlike Bitcoin, which is famously limited to 21 million coins.
Like almost all cryptocurrencies, Ethereum is not backed by any hard assets or cash flow of an underlying entity. Its price is supported only by traders’ sentiment. When traders enter a “greed” or “risk-on” phase, the cryptocurrency has soared. In the “fear” or “risk-off” phase, the coin has plummeted as sellers hit the exits amid anticipated bad news or poor trading conditions.
Here’s how the price of Ethereum has risen and fallen over time as well as some of the trends driving those moves.
While Ethereum was launched on July 30, 2015, it’s tough to find pricing on it until a week or so later. The crypto closed that day at a reported $2.77 and then bounced around below $1 for months, as the newly launched digital currency looked for support among crypto fans.
Then to start 2016, the price inched up to $1 per coin, where it closed on Jan. 10 — and then it never looked back. By the end of the month, it had hit more than $2, and then 10 days later it hit $4. March saw the coin trade for more than $10 for most of the month and then consolidated until May, when it broke decidedly above that trading range before spiking above $20 in June.
But the spike was short-lived, and Ethereum fell back to a trading range of $10 to $12 for the next few months. After a brief jump above $14 in September, the cryptocurrency spent the rest of the year in a downtrend closing out 2016 at around $8 — still good for a 754 percent gain on the year.
Cryptocurrency hit the mainstream in 2017, with the broader public suddenly discovering digital currencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. This attention led to a huge melt-up in these assets.
Ethereum started the year at less than $10, but by the middle of the year it had soared to well over $300, as traders flocked to the coin. But all that heat needed time to cool off, and less than a month later, Ethereum was back below $200 again. The price needed time to consolidate, and danced between $200 and $400 before settling around $300 in early November.
At this point, crypto fever began sweeping the world in late 2017, and it seemed like the sky was the limit. By late December, Ethereum had barrelled through $800, and just a week into 2018, it surpassed the $1,000 threshold and then a week later, $1,300. The deliriously quick rise acted as its own accelerant, moving the crypto ever higher as more traders rushed to cash in.
But the rest of 2018 was downhill. Ethereum plunged below $400 by the end of March, a stunning decline in less than three months. While it rebounded to more than $800 by early May, the selling pressure was too intense and the rest of the year saw the crypto move sharply lower. Ethereum closed the year at $133 — a gobsmacking 82 percent lower from the year before.
The situation improved by mid-year 2019, with Ethereum peaking around $338 in late June. But from there it trended lower, basically back to where it started the year.
After a period of consolidation that saw Ethereum end 2019 basically even with where it started the year, the cryptocurrency went on a strong run in 2020.
Ethereum moved up nicely to start the year, but then like most risk assets such as stocks, it plunged in March with the emergence of the COVID pandemic. As part of the recovery efforts, the Federal Reserve dropped interest rates to near zero and pumped liquidity into the market in other ways, such as by buying debt securities. Those efforts helped juice both the stock market and crypto prices, sending both soaring through 2020 and most of 2021.
In May, China announced that it was cracking down on buyers, but Ethereum mostly shrugged off that news. The country also warned that it was banning financial institutions and payment platforms from using cryptocurrency to conduct business. In September, China announced that all crypto transactions would be considered illegal and that foreign websites offering these services to Chinese investors were against the law. But it didn’t seem to stop Ethereum from powering higher.
Ethereum started 2020 around $130 but seemed to move inexorably higher throughout the year, finishing around $737 — a stunning run in just 12 months.
The first five months of 2021 saw Ethereum continue that impressive run. Just a few days into the new year, it had already surpassed $1,000. By the start of April, it doubled from there to $2,000. By the start of May, Ethereum ran to more than $3,000, and then on May 11 it surpassed $4,000 — spiraling only higher, it seemed. But the run ended there.
Ethereum spent the next two months falling and then consolidating, before ultimately rallying in August and ultimately peaking at more than $4,800 in early November. The Federal Reserve indicated its intention to soon raise interest rates and otherwise remove liquidity from the system, leading to a fierce sell-off of both stocks and the highly speculative crypto market.
In August, Ethereum also implemented a change that saw the crypto begin to “burn” a portion of the transaction fees on its network, permanently destroying them. The move helped make the crypto more deflationary, supporting its price over the longer term. Ethereum closed 2021 at just below $3,700, up 399 percent for the year.
Yet, Ethereum spent 2022 in a downturn, despite relief rallies throughout the year, ultimately bottoming near $1,000 in June. The big news this year was the so-called Ethereum Merge, the crypto’s move from a “proof-of-work” system to a more efficient “proof-of-stake” system.
The crypto coin finished the year down some 67 percent, closing at $1,196. The Fed raised interest rates furiously through much of the year, and high-profile blow-ups such as at crypto exchange FTX pummeled investors’ confidence.
Ethereum rallied strongly in 2023, as it became clearer that the future path of interest rates would be less severe than anticipated. Despite an SEC crackdown on exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase, Ethereum rallied for much of the year, though it hit a rough patch in August. But by October, it was moving higher as the Fed began to indicate that the path of interest rates was lower, before ending the year at nearly $2,300 — up 91 percent for the year.
While the price of Ethereum was already on the upswing in 2023, it got a further boost in early 2024, following the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. This approval opened the possibility that Ethereum ETFs would also be a possibility, and the crypto coin rallied.
In late May, the SEC approved Ethereum spot ETFs in principle, paving the way for them to be traded on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.

Ethereum (ETH) is down 6% on Tuesday after the recent general crypto market decline canceled out gains seen in the past five days. If ETH fails to bounce off the lower boundary support line of a symmetrical triangle pattern, it could crash to the $3,000 psychological level.
Ethereum investors have been withdrawing their assets from staking protocols since early December. According to CryptoQuant's data, over 500,000 ETH have flowed out of staking protocols in the past month. Despite the crypto market maintaining a slightly bullish structure, these substantial net outflows could affect ETH's long-term prospects.

A decline in the total amount of staked ETH indicates investors may not be willing to hold on to their positions in the long term.
A potential reason for the staking outflows could be profit-taking among investors due to rising prices in the past two months.
Meanwhile, Santiment data shows that the recent ETH selling activity came from coins less than one year old, after a slight increase in the 90-day, 180-day and 365-day Dormant Circulation. Some of these coins were sold at a loss of over $6.6 million.

Such movements among short-term holders are expected during price swings.
Crypto analytics platform Lookonchain's data also showed that asset manager WisdomTree deposited 11,733 ETH worth about $42.61 million into Coinbase just before the market's sharp decline.
Additionally, Ethereum exchange-traded funds witnessed net inflows of $128.7 million on Monday, with BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) raking in $124.1 million inflows.
In the past 24 hours, ETH futures recorded over $73 million in liquidations, with long positions accounting for $64.05 million and short positions for $9.01 million, per Coinglass data.
Ethereum is consolidating within a key symmetrical triangle pattern extending from December 16. After seeing a rejection at the triangle's upper boundary, ETH has crossed below the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and is testing the lower boundary support line.

A bounce off the lower boundary support line where the 100-day and 50-day SMAs converge could help ETH surge above the symmetrical triangle and the resistance level near $3,780. If ETH completes this move with a high volume, it could overcome the $4,093 key resistance level. A breakout above $4,093 may propel ETH to tackle its all-time high resistance at $4,868.
However, if ETH declines below the lower boundary and SMAs support, it could decline toward the $3,000 psychological level. A move below this level could see ETH finding support near the $2,817 key level.
After bouncing off the overbought region line, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is below its neutral level. Meanwhile, the Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) has retreated into the oversold region, indicating ETH could see a recovery soon 
A daily candlestick close below $2,817 will invalidate the thesis.
Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain with smart contracts functionality. Its native currency Ether (ETH), is the second-largest cryptocurrency and number one altcoin by market capitalization. The Ethereum network is tailored for building crypto solutions like decentralized finance (DeFi), GameFi, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), etc.
Ethereum is a public decentralized blockchain technology, where developers can build and deploy applications that function without the need for a central authority. To make this easier, the network leverages the Solidity programming language and Ethereum virtual machine which helps developers create and launch applications with smart contract functionality.
Smart contracts are publicly verifiable codes that automates agreements between two or more parties. Basically, these codes self-execute encoded actions when predetermined conditions are met.
Staking is a process of earning yield on your idle crypto assets by locking them in a crypto protocol for a specified duration as a means of contributing to its security. Ethereum transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism on September 15, 2022, in an event christened “The Merge.” The Merge was a key part of Ethereum's roadmap to achieve high-level scalability, decentralization and security while remaining sustainable. Unlike PoW, which requires the use of expensive hardware, PoS reduces the barrier of entry for validators by leveraging the use of crypto tokens as the core foundation of its consensus process.
Gas is the unit for measuring transaction fees that users pay for conducting transactions on Ethereum. During periods of network congestion, gas can be extremely high, causing validators to prioritize transactions based on their fees.

Bitcoin and crypto prices have bounced back, with bitcoin surging toward $100,000 after a sudden downturn sparked fears of a crypto crash.

The bitcoin price rocketed higher in the aftermath of Donald Trump's election victory in November, with Trump last month confirming he's planning to drop a bitcoin price bombshell.
Now, as the Federal Reserve braces for a looming crisis, Trump, the self-styled crypto president, will reportedly issue several crypto-related executive orders on his first day back in the White House, January 20—with one predicted to spark a huge bitcoin price boom.

Incoming U.S. president Donald Trump has reportedly made it priority to issue several bitcoin and ... More crypto executive orders—predicted to send the bitcoin price soaring.
Trump's day-one executive orders may address issues including de-banking and the repeal of a controversial crypto accounting policy requiring banks holding bitcoin and crypto to count them as liabilities on the bank's own balance sheet.
""The Trump team has made it very clear that this is a priority,"" an anonymous source told the Washington Post.
01/15 update: Bitcoin has surged following the latest U.S. data that showed headline prices climbed as expected but core inflation, striping out food and fuel, came in slightly below predictions.
The bitcoin price has rocketed toward $100,000 per bitcoin, almost entirely erasing its early January decline.
The inflation data means the Federal Reserve may be more inclined than previously thought to reduce interest rates through 2025, feeding risk assets such as bitcoin with increased liquidity.
""Bitcoin is also currently undergoing a local test as its price surpasses the $97,000 mark,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst, said in comments ahead of the inflation data drop. ""It is now challenging the 50-day moving average from below, a level it dropped beneath just over a week ago. The rally, with global equity indices relatively neutral, indicates a gradual recovery in risk appetite.""
The bitcoin price recovery from a dip last week, may now have ""run its course,"" according to Geoff Kendrick, head of crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, who maintained his bullish bitcoin price prediction for 2025 in an emailed note.
""We would recommend accumulating longs again,"" Kendrick wrote. ""We continue to target bitcoin at the $200,000 level by end-2025 as institutional inflows resume under the Trump administration.""
The mysterious, unconfirmed so-called ""Operation ChokePoint 2.0""—named for a similar, 2013 U.S. Department of Justice policy to de-bank legal industries deemed to be high risk for fraud and money laundering—has weighed on crypto companies through the Biden administration, with founders and executives claiming financial regulators have pressured banks to cut off crypto companies from financial services.
The issue was recently catapulted into mainstream consciousness by venture capitalist Marc Andreessen's appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast.
Andreessen, who has backed many tech and crypto companies at the VC company known as a16z and is an associate of Trump's so-called crypto czar David Sacks, is reportedly working with Trump’s incoming administration behind the scenes.
Meanwhile, crypto companies led by MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor have been campaigning against the policy that requires companies to report crypto as a liability, a result of a March 2022 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff accounting bulletin, SAB121.
The repeal of SAB121 is one of the three catalysts Saylor said would trigger a bitcoin price rally to $5 million—giving bitcoin a total market capitalization of $100 trillion.

The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, with the November election of Donald Trump push ... More bitcoin sharply higher.
Last year, Saylor, who has transformed his software company into a bitcoin-buying vehicle over the last five years, said during an X broadcast that the repeal of SAB121 will help ""take us to $5 million a coin"" as companies and financial institutions begin buying bitcoin.
""The other two [catalysts named by Salyor] have already happened (spot [exchange-traded funds] ETFs and fair value accounting),"" Julian Fahrer, the chief executive of bitcoin rewards company Apollo, posted to X.
Last year, the world's largest asset manager BlackRock led a Wall Street rush into the newly approved spot bitcoin ETFs, with its IBIT bitcoin fund becoming one of the fastest growing ETFs of all time as traders piled in.
In November, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) officially adopted fair value accounting for bitcoin, allowing companies to more accurately reflect bitcoin's current market value in their financial statements.

Ethereum's value against Bitcoin has plummeted to its lowest level in over four years amid shifting institutional preferences and technical challenges.
The ratio now stands at 0.028,per data from RatioGang, having dropped as low as 0.027 in the past day—indicating just how far Ethereum is currently underperforming relative to Bitcoin.
Over the past month, Ethereum has declined by approximately 13.8% against Bitcoin. The ratio's gradual decline has tumbled more than 70% since September 2022.
Despite this, a “mildly positive sentiment” for ETH in the medium to long term can be seen, Sean Dawson, head of research at Derive.xyz, told Decrypt.
This forecast comes “with 25 delta skews, a measure of bullish sentiment, hovering at +8.6% and +9.4% respectively,” Dawson noted. “This means calls are more expensive than puts, possibly indicating positive sentiment into Q3 and beyond.""
Broader on-chain indicators on market price over realized price also point to a declining trend, according to data from South Korean blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant.
""Ethereum has continued to underperform Bitcoin […] partially driven by Ethereum becoming inflationary again,"" analysts from CryptoQuant said in a late January report referring to the crypto’s ballooning supply.
The supply metrics show that Ethereum has grown at an average rate of 5.4% since February 2024, from 120.1 million tokens in circulation to 120.52 million, according to data from YCharts.
“Although it may not seem like a large supply increase, it is significant as Ethereum was supposed to be deflationary after the Merge upgrade,” CryptoQuant added.
Notably, the current supply of Ethereum has gone back to the same level as before that upgrade, which began after Ethereum transitioned to proof-of-stake in 2022.
Compared to other chains aside from Bitcoin, Ethereum has also fallen in fee revenue, now ranking sixth after Circle's USDC and Solana, according to data from Token Terminal.
While Bitcoin surged 121.4% last year, Ethereum significantly underperformed, returning just 46.29%, according to CoinGecko data.
“Ethereum has not caught a bid due to a lack of strong catalysts to support price relative to Bitcoin,” Pratik Kala, head of research at Apollo Crypto, told Decrypt.
The performance gap widened further with the launch of spot ETFs, as Bitcoin products attracted $35 billion in inflows compared to Ethereum's modest $2.6 billion.
While Bitcoin has “a range of large buyers [such as] MicroStrategy,” no such demand exists for Ethereum, Kala explained, noting that ETF appetite for Ethereum had been “lackluster.”
Network participation across the Ethereum ecosystem also shows concerning trends.
Active validators dropped 1% last month, while delays on the Pectra upgrade and underwhelming previous updates have allowed competitors like Solana to capture over 50% of DEX trading volume, though most of this ""stems from pumpdotfun activity,"" according to data from an OKX report.
The Pectra upgrade is expected to arrive by March, according to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. If implemented, these key changes could “lead to a reversal” of Ethereum’s downtrend, Kala said.
Pectra, expected in March, will increase the blob target from 3 to 6, doubling the capacity of L2s.
IMO we should make the blob target also staker-voted, so that it can increase in respose to technology improvements without waiting for hard forks.
— vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) February 4, 2025

Internal tensions among organizations involved with Ethereum's technical development have also compounded these market pressures.
Earlier in January, Ethereum Foundation (EF) executive director Aya Miyaguchi faced criticism following a mistranslated Japanese interview, prompting Buterin to respond to the perceived toxicity, saying he's responsible for decisions until such time reforms could give the EF a ""proper board.""
In the same week, Etherealize, a project supported by the EF, was launched in a bid to attract Wall Street investors to the Ethereum ecosystem.
""Over the past year, BTC has dominated institutional inflows and market attention, particularly in anticipation of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval. Ethereum, however, has seen relatively muted price action despite its growing institutional adoption, most notably with Blackrock's BUIDL fund leveraging the Ethereum network,"" Le Shi, managing director at Auros, told Decrypt.
These developments have led the Ethereum community to go through some “soul-searching,” Kala of Apollo Crypto noted, adding that at present, “there seems to be a lack of clear leadership and direction which is keeping investors at bay.”
At least for now, the crypto market’s atmosphere has clear skies: Bitcoin's simpler narrative and stronger institutional adoption have created a formidable headwind for Ethereum's broader ecosystem ambitions.

The cryptocurrency market has entered consolidation, with Bitcoin (BTC) struggling to rally past $100,000. Altcoins are also working to make a recovery, with the altcoin season index dropping to 39, marking its lowest level in two months.
The recent downturn has affected market sentiment. Per trader Ali Charts on X, the Fear and Greed Index has entered into fear for the first time since October last year.
This negative market sentiment could fuel bearish trends if traders choose to panic sell. Additionally, it could affect the market demand if buyers become hesitant, leading to consolidation and failed recoveries.
Altcoin & Meme Coin Bloodbath Drives Market into Fear
Despite Bitcoin’s drop below the psychological level of $100,000, the king coin’s losses have been minimal compared to altcoins. This has seen Bitcoin’s market dominance surging past 60%.
At the same time, Ethereum’s market dominance continues to steadily decline, falling to below 11%. This follows ETH’s 17% drop in just one week, at the same time. ETH/BTC had declined to range lows of 0.278 at press time.
Meme coins have also not been spared from the volatility after their total market capitalization dropped to $68 billion, the lowest level in three months. The meme coin fear and greed index has also declined to 27, indicating that meme coin traders are in fear. 
In just one week, the largest meme coin, Dogecoin (DOGE), has declined by 25%, while Shiba Inu (SHIB) is down by 20%. PEPE (PEPE) and dogwifhat (WIF) have also dropped by 29% and 38%, respectively.
These widespread losses are behind the decline in trader sentiment. Moreover, if the market fails to post a recovery, it could result in further losses if traders begin to sell to minimize their losses. 
Institutional Interest Remains Constant
Despite the weak demand for cryptocurrencies from retail traders, institutional interest has remained notably high. Data from SoSoValue shows that the total weekly inflows to Ethereum have surged to $420M, marking the highest weekly level since late December.
However, despite these inflows, JPMorgan analysts noted that many institutional traders remained hesitant to trade cryptocurrencies this year. Moreover, the percentage of investors willing to invest in crypto assets has declined from 78% to 71%.
The waning interest comes despite a friendlier crypto regulatory framework in the United States under the Trump administration and the resignation of the chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler.

Investors last week saw a buying opportunity for Ethereum, and threw more cash at funds built around the second-largest cryptocurrency than those for Bitcoin. What’s more, it’s the first time this year that weekly deposits into Ethereum-based funds have outpaced those into BTC products. 
Data from European asset manager CoinShares shows that speculators pumped $793 million into Ethereum-related investment products worldwide, last week.
CoinShares said that “Ethereum stole the show,” when investors saw a buying opportunity after the coin’s price dropped to nearly $2,100.
In my opinion, it’s a great time to add $ETH.
— Eric Trump (@EricTrump) February 3, 2025

Some investors may have been motivated by a tweet from Eric Trump, the son of President Donald Trump, who wrote last Monday, ""In my opinion, it’s a great time to add ETH."" The tweet earned some 13.6 million views. The original version of the tweet, which Trump edited, also included the sentence, ""You can thank me later.""
ETH is now trading for $2,670, CoinGecko shows. The asset has struggled to break to new highs, despite the launch of new American ETH exchange-traded funds last July. It is currently trading 45% below its November 2021 record price of $4,878. 
Meanwhile, Bitcoin has experienced huge amounts of new capital thanks to the spot ETFs approved one year ago. As a result, the price of BTC has hit new records—especially following the election of Donald Trump in November. The new U.S. leader has promised to help the digital assets industry. 
Last week, though, Bitcoin-related funds only received $407 million in net inflows. President Trump’s threat of tariffs spooked investors across most asset classes—and crypto was no different. 
Meanwhile investors eyed up top altcoins XRP and Solana, throwing $21 million and $11 million, respectively, at funds giving exposure to the cryptocurrencies, CoinShares said.  
ETH has had quite the turnaround in investor sentiment: Last week, funds giving exposure to the coin received net flows of zero. 
Will a change in crypto investors’ hearts lead to new records for the coin itself? Or will this prove to be a one-time fluke, given how dominant Bitcoin has been in the crypto ETF space? Stay tuned.

The cryptocurrency’s accumulation addresses received a whopping $883M on February 7 – the highest daily inflow ever.
Moreover, long-term holders are now holding over $19.24M worth of $ETH, which is also a record. This number, by the way, has jumped 20.55% in 2025, which, combined with the fact that $ETH’s price has dropped by 20.75% this year, reflects investors’ confidence in Ethereum. 
Simply put, an increasing number of investors are HODLing Ethereum, expecting a big move in the near future.
Further evidence that $ETH’s record-breaking daily info is a bullish sign is the observation that Ethereum’s price shoots up after accumulation peaks like this.

For instance, Ethereum’s price rose by 35% just two months after 244K ETH (a record at that time) were accumulated on a single day (on February 26, 2023).
With Ethereum set to test (and potentially break) all-time highs, we’ve picked 6 meme coins to explode and follow $ETH on its upwards trajectory.
1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Best Meme Coin to Buy In 2025
Solaxy ($SOLX) has arrived at just the right time for Solana. Although $SOL has been pretty sensational of late – 89% gains in the last one year – plus it’s now holding support and is ready for a breakout, it has admittedly been struggling to accommodate the growing number of users.

This is where Solaxy comes in. As the first layer 2 solution on Solana, $SOLX will solve the problems of network congestion, failed transactions, and limited scalability on the blockchain. The $SOLX presale has been well received by both retail traders and whales alike. For instance, a whale bought $122K $SOLX just over a month ago. 
The total presale raise now stands at an impressive $19M, with each token currently being offered at just $0.00163. If this is your first time investing in a crypto presale, here’s a detailed guide on how to buy $SOLX.
2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Leverage AI to Become a Profitable Crypto Trader
MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is a one-of-a-kind fusion between AI and crypto that promises to alter how retail traders have been approaching the crypto market.
It’s a self-evolving AI agent that constantly talks to crypto influencers and communities on dApps and social media sites like X, listening to their beliefs and biases regarding crypto.

Next, $MIND organizes and then declutters all that information to offer trading signals and unique market insights to its token holders. Additionally, MIND of Pepe is also capable of shaping conversations and hype online, acting as a catalyst for new trending cryptos that it has recommended to its community. 
Simply put, this frog-inspired meme coin is poised for tremendous growth, as it’s a sigh of relief for retail crypto traders who have been struggling to make consistent profits.
You can buy 1 $MIND for $0.0032924 if you get in right now. The $MIND madness has already raised over $5.5M, and it doesn’t look like slowing down. Here’s how to buy $MIND.
3. Meme Index ($MEMEX) – The Meme Coin Market Is No Longer Risky
Meme Index ($MEMEX) is one of the best cryptos to buy now because it has the potential to not only change how people view the memecoin market but also attract more investors to this corner of crypto.

Taking inspiration from how index funds function in stock markets, $MEMEX is the first provider of meme coin baskets. It offers four baskets of meme coins, ranging from the very safe Meme Titan Index (includes only the top cryptos in the world) to the high-risk, high-reward Meme Frenzy Index. 
There’s also the Moonshot Index and the Meme Midcap Index, which offer handsome returns in exchange for a decent risk appetite.
All in all, because $MEMEX simplifies and diversifies meme coin investing, it has the potential to put crypto alongside the major financial markets in the world.
Meme Index is currently in presale, where it has already raised $3.5M. Each token is now available at $0.0160352, but hurry up because the price increases in the next few hours.
4. Department Of Government Efficiency ($DOGE) – Benefit from the Musk-Led New US Govt Body
We’re all well aware of the OG $DOGE, but with Donald Trump winning the elections and Elon Musk getting his own way, there’s a new DOGE in town – Department of Government Efficiency.
Although the name of this US government department is indeed amusing, the work it does (or at least aspires to do) is very serious.

Under the leadership of Musk, DOGE wants to reduce bloated federal spending, alleviating the tax burden on US citizens.
DOGE’s X account constantly updates about the good work it has been doing. For instance, the organization has apparently saved over $5B in just the last two days by terminating wasteful contracts.
As a result, this ETH-based token finds itself on the list of top gainers. It’s up by a mind-boggling 35% in the last 24 hours.
Moreover, with a lifetime return of over 12,000% and truckloads of more fruitful work ahead, this $DOGE (currently priced at $0.065) is undoubtedly one of the top crypto buys under $1.
5. SPX6900 ($SPX) – Unique S&P 500 Index Meme Coin
SPX6900 is another meme coin that has reacted positively to ETH’s accumulation news. It has jumped by over 8% today – and nearly 40,000% in the last year!
Built on the Ethereum network, SPX6900 is an S&P 500-based meme coin that has an amusing goal of reaching 69T in valuation. Of course, there’s no point digging into the “why” of this fictional index’s mission.

Thanks to SPX6900’s large community (82K followers on X and over 19K subscribers on its Telegram) and never-ending social media hype, it’s currently one of the best new cryptocurrencies.
Currently trading at $0.67, the token also boasts a massive market cap of $624M, which is one of the biggest in the entire industry.
Verdict
Everything considered, it’s worth noting that even the best meme coins to explode aren’t free from the clutches of the overall crypto market’s volatility.
That’s why you should only invest an amount you’re comfortable sidelining for the foreseeable future.
Also, none of the above is a substitute for financial advice, and you must always do your own research before investing.

Welcome to the Canadian Crypto Observer. Financial journalist and author Aditya Nain offers perspective on market-moving headlines to help Canadian investors navigate the cryptocurrency market.

Whether we like it or not, the Canadian crypto market depends heavily on what happens in the U.S. Not long ago—under the Biden administration—the U.S. government was ambivalent about bitcoin and crypto. Leading U.S-based crypto companies like Coinbase and Ripple (creator of the XRP cryptocurrency) faced heavy regulatory headwinds, and innovation in the industry was at a standstill.
However, with President Donald Trump taking office again—and having become a crypto advocate—it seems like the U.S. government is announcing new crypto-focused regulation weekly. Could these moves spur bitcoin (BTC) past $100,000 (all figures in U.S. dollars) again in 2025?
Here are the top five moves that Trump has made with regard to the crypto industry:
Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum platform, has grossly underperformed BTC over the past year, and ETH investors are understandably unhappy. As of Feb. 18, while BTC has risen about 80% over the past year, ETH is down 8%.
It doesn’t help that the Ethereum community has witnessed some online drama, with tussles over leadership changes at the Ethereum Foundation (EF). While Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, wants to maintain control of personnel changes at the foundation, he’s facing pressure from those in the community who are unhappy with the current state of affairs. To be sure, EF does not centrally control ETH or its price. However, because it’s an important part of Ethereum’s community, trouble with EF negatively affects investor sentiment and contributes to negative price performance. And there’s another headache: increased ETH short positions by hedge funds betting against the cryptocurrency. Simply put, when you hold a short position on a cryptocurrency (or any other security), you’re adding downward pressure on the price. You’re betting on a fall in the price of the coin.
The pile up in ether shorts soared by a stunning 40% in one week to the highest on record. https://t.co/DL6ixY5JNm pic.twitter.com/5oUE7KmT6Q
It’s unclear whether ETH’s position as the second-largest cryptocurrency—by market capitalization—is under threat in the medium term. However, as this chart shows, ETH has struggled not just against BTC, but also against its biggest competitor, Solana (SOL).
The chart above shows that while BTC (blue) and SOL (purple) have gained 81% and 45%, respectively, over the past year, ETH (red) has lost over 6%. 
Here’s another staggering figure: 42%. That’s how much ETH’s share of the total crypto market has fallen over the past year. In comparison, over the same period, BTC’s dominance has increased by 14.9% and SOL’s by 1.2%.
As a result of the 42% decrease in ETH’s dominance, its share of the total crypto market dropped below 10% for the first time since July 2021. As of Feb. 18, it sits at 10.3%.

Here’s how I see it: I’m not ditching Ethereum yet. ETH has largely maintained its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency since before 2017, and the platform has shown itself capable of technological innovation. Further, it has built a large global community of technologists, developers, users and investors. There’s something to be said for longevity and a proven track record, especially in an industry like crypto, where thousands of new projects start and end from one year to the next.
So, while SOL deserves a place in a multi-crypto portfolio, I don’t see it taking ETH’s place just yet. However, ETH is in a precarious position, and possibly at a crossroads. It remains to be seen where it goes from here.
We’ve ranked the best crypto exchanges in Canada.
On Jan. 13, 2025, an institutional behemoth entered the Canadian crypto space. 
Blackrock iShares launched iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT.TO), a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), listed on CBOE Canada. While spot bitcoin ETFs have been available in Canada for three years, Blackrock’s entry into the Canadian crypto ETF market marks a watershed moment. 
Blackrock’s U.S. bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which IBIT.TO holds, is by far the largest crypto ETF in the world, with assets under management of over USD$57 billion (as of Feb. 18). And it had the third-highest inflows of all ETFs globally in 2024—behind only Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO) and Blackrock’s own iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV).
As a global leader in both ETFs and crypto, Blackrock is uniquely positioned to shake things up in the Canadian crypto ETF space. The most obvious illustration of this is that Fidelity reduced the management fee of its Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) to match IBIT’s (from 0.39% to 0.32%) on the day that IBIT started trading in Canada.
Here’s a table of all spot bitcoin ETFs in Canada, with their assets under management (AUM) and management fees:
As I showed in last month’s column, in previous crypto market cycles, prices topped out in November or December of the year following the bitcoin halving. If history repeats itself—and that’s a big if—the current bull market could end later this year, because the previous halving was in 2024. In this scenario, the bull market could still have some legs. So, as a Canadian crypto investor, which crypto coins should you consider investing in?

Here’s something to think about: In the later phases of a crypto bull market—what we’re probably in now—altcoins usually outperform bitcoin. Altcoins are all the cryptocurrencies apart from BTC, which is the oldest and largest. This cyclical altcoin outperformance, which comes around every few years, is known as alt-season. For Canadian investors, this means your ETH, SOL or XRP may give you higher gains than your BTC this year—if the bull market persists.
The traditional approach to gaining exposure to altcoins has been to hold ETH, the largest altcoin and historically a proxy for the altcoin market. Here’s an interesting chart that shows ETH’s outperformance compared to BTC in 2021, the year of the previous bull market top. While BTC gained 87% in 2021, ETH gained a whopping 486%.
However, as I’ve shown above, ETH has been a laggard in this market cycle. So, if you’re considering alternatives, what are your options? Here are the top five altcoins based on market cap, excluding stablecoins:
It’s tax season, and the registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) contribution deadline is quickly approaching: this year, it’s March 3, 2025. If you’re considering a crypto ETF in your RRSP, you’ll find useful information and guidance in my article on crypto ETFs in Canada.
In case you missed it, your tax-free savings account (TFSA) room increased by $7,000 in 2025. Here’s how to invest in bitcoin and other crypto assets tax-free.
Read more about crypto taxation in Canada in my previous column and in MoneySense’s article “What you should know about cryptocurrency tax in Canada.”
Bitcoin, ethereum, solana and other crypto coins are speculative and subject to large price swings during bull and bear markets. While investing in crypto over the long term can be profitable, it carries significant market, technological and regulatory risks. 
As with other growth assets, invest in crypto only if it’s aligned with your investment goals, time horizon and risk profile. Invest only as much money as you’re willing to lose, and be vigilant about crypto scams.

""The incident occurred when our ETH multisig cold wallet executed a transfer to our warm wallet. Unfortunately, this transaction was manipulated through a sophisticated attack that masked the signing interface, displaying the correct address while altering the underlying smart contract logic,"" Bybit said in a post on X.
""As a result, the attacker was able to gain control of the affected ETH cold wallet and transfer its holdings to an unidentified address.""
In a separate statement posted on the social media platform, Bybit's CEO Ben Zhou emphasized that all other cold wallets are secure. The company further said it has reported the case to the appropriate authorities.
While there is no official confirmation from Bybit yet, Elliptic and Arkham Intelligence confirmed that the digital theft is the work of the infamous Lazarus Group. The incident makes it the biggest-ever cryptocurrency heist reported to date, dwarfing that of Ronin Network ($624 million), Poly Network ($611 million), and BNB Bridge ($586 million).
Independent researcher ZachXBT said they ""connected the Bybit hack on-chain to the Phemex hack,"" the latter of which took place late last month.
The North Korea-based threat actor is one of the most prolific hacking groups, orchestrating dozens of cryptocurrency heists to generate illicit revenue for the sanctions-hit nation. Last year, Google described North Korea as ""arguably the world's leading cyber criminal enterprise."" 
In 2024, it's estimated to have stolen $1.34 billion across 47 cryptocurrency hacks, accounting for 61% of all ill-gotten crypto during the time period, according to blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis.
""Cryptocurrency heists are on the rise due to the lucrative nature of their rewards, the challenges associated with attribution to malicious actors, and the opportunities presented by nascent familiarity with cryptocurrency and Web3 technologies among many organizations,"" Google-owned Mandiant said last month.
In a standalone update, Bybit said it detected unauthorized activity within one of our Ethereum (ETH) Cold Wallets during a planned routine transfer process on February 21, 2025, at around 12:30 p.m. UTC.
""The transfer was part of a scheduled move of ETH from our ETH Multisig Cold Wallet to our Hot Wallet,"" it said in a statement.
""Unfortunately, the transaction was manipulated by a sophisticated attack that altered the smart contract logic and masked the signing interface, enabling the attacker to gain control of the ETH Cold Wallet. As a result, over 400,000 ETH and stETH worth more than $1.5 billion were transferred to an unidentified address.""
TRM Labs has also attributed the hack with high confidence to the Lazarus Group, based on ""substantial overlaps observed between addresses controlled by the Bybit hackers and those linked to prior North Korean thefts"" such as Phemex, BingX, and Poloniex.
""The recent incident with Bybit marks a new phase in attack methods, featuring advanced techniques for manipulating user interfaces,"" Check Point Research noted. ""Instead of just exploiting protocol mechanics, the attackers employed advanced social engineering through manipulated interfaces, allowing them to compromise a significant institutional multisig setup.""
The cybersecurity company also pointed out that the attack highlights a scenario where threat actors are manipulating legitimate transactions through the Gnosis Safe Protocol's execTransaction function, stating ""multisig cold wallets are not secure if signers can be deceived or compromised, emphasizing the growing sophistication of supply chain and user interface manipulation attacks.""
In a detailed analysis published over the weekend, Elliptic noted that the Lazarus Group's laundering process follows a characteristic pattern, which involves exchanging stolen tokens for a native blockchain asset like Ether to avoid attempts to freeze the digital assets.
""This is exactly what happened in the minutes following the Bybit theft, with hundreds of millions of dollars in stolen tokens such as stETH and cmETH exchanged for Ether,"" the company stated, adding the funds were layered to cover up the transaction trail by routing them to 50 different wallets within two hours of the theft, and then shifting them through crypto exchanges like eXch to convert them into bitcoin.
""North Korea's Lazarus Group is the most sophisticated and well-resourced launderer of cryptoassets in existence, continually adapting its techniques to evade identification and seizure of stolen assets,"" Elliptic said.
Elliptic further called out cryptocurrency exchange eXch for allowing North Korean threat actors to launder the ill-gotten proceeds by allowing its users to swap crypto assets anonymously. It's assessed that stolen cryptocurrency from Bybit worth over $75 million have been exchanged using eXch, converting the digital funds into bitcoin.
However, eXch has denied laundering funds stolen from Bybit, stating it is ""NOT laundering money for Lazarus/DPRK"" and that ""insignificant part of funds that was processed by us from the ByBit hack in an isolated case will be donated to various open-source initiatives dedicated to privacy and security both inside and outside crypto space.""
""They certainly are laundering the funds stolen by DPRK from Bybit – it's visible on the blockchain,"" Dr. Tom Robinson, co-founder and chief scientist at Elliptic, told The Hacker News.
""Over $75 million of the stolen funds have been laundered through eXch so far. They are trying to conceal it and the total figure may be more than this. And this isn't the first time – cryptoassets from multiple previous DPRK-attributed hacks have been sent through eXch.""
(The story was updated after publication to include additional information and revise the total amount of cryptocurrency stolen in the incident.)

Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade has also encountered issues. The upgrade was deployed on the Sepolia testnet on March 5, 2025, but developers soon noticed errors, including blocks being mined without transactions. Ethereum developer Marius van der Wijden confirmed that a fix was deployed, but the same error was later triggered again by an unknown user, causing further disruptions. The development team eventually stabilized the testnet, allowing transactions to resume normally.
Harz said that while these testnet problems are delaying the mainnet launch, they are not Ethereum’s biggest concern. He explained that Pectra will increase data availability for layer-2 networks, reduce costs, and improve execution capacity. However, he argued that Ethereum is losing its status as the leading blockchain for developers and that Pectra alone will not solve the deeper problems the network faces.
The sharp reduction in gas fees is a major improvement for users, but Ethereum’s price decline and technical challenges raise concerns about its long-term position in the market. While the network continues to evolve, its ability to maintain dominance in the crypto space remains uncertain.

Bitcoin(BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is up 7% in afternoon trading on April 9 after President Trump announced that he is pausing for 90 days U.S. import duties on most countries and moving to adopt a universal duty of 10% for most foreign products. BTC is now trading at $82,500. It had been as low as $77,000 in recent days.
Other digital coins and tokens are also surging higher on news of the tariff relief, with Ethereum(ETH) up 13%, Solana (SOL) up 15%, and Dogecoin(DOGE) rising 12%. Stocks associated with crypto such as MicroStrategy (MSTR), Robinhood Markets (HOOD), and Coinbase (COIN) are also skyrocketing, with each up more than 20% on the day.
Cryptocurrencies and stocks are rebounding strongly as some of the uncertainty related to Trump’s tariff policies abates and investors flood back into risk assets. However, crypto prices had fallen steeply in recent weeks, with Bitcoin dropping 25% from its January all-time high. Over the past few days, crypto had largely traded in-tandem with equities, both of which had fallen sharply lower.
Bitcoin and other digital assets are now rising with stocks in the biggest rally in five years for the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, the trade volatility may not be over as President Trump also announced that he is raising tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%, the highest level yet. Chinese officials in Beijing have vowed to fight back against U.S. trade protectionism.
Most Wall Street firms don’t offer ratings or price targets on Bitcoin, so we’ll look at the cryptocurrency’s three-month performance instead. As one can see in the chart below, the price of BTC has declined 19.10% in the last 12 weeks.
