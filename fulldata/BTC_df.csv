Runes takes the Ordinals protocol a step further by making transactions even cheaper and faster. Ordinals are a way to embed data into the Bitcoin blockchain by inscribing references to digital art into small Bitcoin-based transactions.
The much-hyped Runes went live after Bitcoin’s fourth halving on April 20. Data tracked on Dune Analytics shows that in its first 10 days the protocol racked up more than 85,000 token issuances and generated over $3 million in fees.
In the past two weeks, however, all the metrics – including fees, new Runes and user activity – have dropped more than 50%. Only some 5,000 new Runes have been issued since May 1, generating just under $100,000 in fees.
At its peak, Runes led transactions and fees in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem, accounting for as much as 80% of all network activity. Now it's 20%. Worth noting, however, is that the downturn came amid a general market decline marked by falling bitcoin (BTC) prices and slow growth in alternative tokens, which may have contributed to a drop in sentiment for novel technology.
Runes generated massive interest on social platform X before its launch with creator Casey Rodamor aiming to make it a protocol ripe for meme coin trading and “degen” traders. Some industry participants expected the protocol to mirror the flourishing meme coin ecosystem on blockchains such as Solana and Base – likely fueling interest and bets on little-known memes.
PUPS, a Runes token, emerged as a big play and surged from under $10 million capitalization to over $150 million in under a week, gaining support from several noted traders such as BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes.
Several NFT collections and tokens were launched on Ordinals, and even on Ethereum, before the protocol's introduction – each aiming to transfer over and become the biggest compilation after the launch. Such activity made Bitcoin-based NFTs top other collections on the usual leaders Ethereum and Solana, with tens of millions exchanging hands in an otherwise scant market for non-fungible tokens.
Some skeptics say that while Runes may serve as a way to build the Bitcoin ecosystem, there’s still work to be done.
""The success of the Bitcoin L2 project based on OP_Return is doubtful as UTXO based blockchain network is fundamentally different from smart contract based network,"" Ho Chan Chung, head of marketing at CryptoQuant, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. ""The current notion of Bitcoin narrative as a digital currency combined, and the difference in the blockchain network fundamental are the two big hurdles that Bitcoin L2 projects need to overcome.""
""Lightning network was able to prove it. However, Ordinals, BRC-20, and Runes all seemed to fail at winning the narrative for now."" Chung added.

 Bitcoin (BTC) briefly crossed $70,000 on Monday after spending most of last week below that mark. However, it was BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) that grabbed headlines after toppling Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as the largest spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by assets.

 In addition, U.S. President Joe Biden vetoed a crypto bill that passed both houses of Congress and a Japanese crypto exchange was hacked for more than $300 million worth of bitcoin. Meanwhile, Keith Gill, the man behind the meme-stock frenzy in 2021, fueled a rally in some meme coins with his latest bet.

 A little over four months since it began trading on Jan. 11, BlackRock's bitcoin ETF became the largest spot bitcoin ETF by assets, passing Grayscale's GBTC for the top spot. At the end of May, IBIT's assets stood at $19.5 billion while GBTC's were $19.385 billion.

 GBTC is the oldest fund, with bitcoin investments that converted to an ETF when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allowed spot bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. At that time, GBTC's assets surpassed $24 billion.

 However, as soon as other comparable products began trading, investors pulled large sums of money out of GBTC, resulting in roughly $17.9 billion in net outflows since Jan. 11. In sharp contrast, BlackRock’s IBIT has reported substantial inflows, pulling in about $16.6 billion this year, according to Farside Investors.
The disparity in fees between Grayscale's ETF and other bitcoin ETFs from Blackrock, Fidelity, and others has played a crucial role in the competition that Grayscale's fund has faced. For example, GBTC charges a 1.5% fee, while IBIT comes with a 0.25% fee. Notably, Grayscale plans to soon launch an alternative spot bitcoin ETF offering with lower fees under the BTC ticker.

 President Biden, as anticipated, vetoed a bill aimed at overturning the SEC's special regulations for custodians of crypto assets. This SEC policy could pose significant challenges for traditional financial firms looking to offer crypto custodial services.

 The White House previously had signaled its intention to veto the legislation. In a statement, President Biden expressed a desire establish a balanced regulatory framework for digital assets under the authority of existing regulatory agencies.

 According to Axios, critics noted that the time for Congress to review the SEC's procedural action under the Administrative Procedure Act had lapsed, and they argued the policy didn't constitute a rule, a point contested by the Government Accountability Office.

 Banking trade organizations urged the president to support the removal of the rule, claiming it would make crypto custodial services prohibitively expensive for traditional finance firms, ultimately disadvantaging their customers.

 This move from the Biden White House follows a perceived reversal on crypto policy when various filings for spot ether ETFs were approved late last month by the SEC after it was assumed a rejection of these financial products was imminent.

 Former President Donald Trump also has reversed his initial position on bitcoin and other crypto assets, going as far as to make a campaign promise to release convicted Silk Road online marketplace operator Ross Ulbricht from prison. Ulbricht is serving a life sentence for running a platform where illegal drugs and other illicit items were purchased using bitcoin.

 On Friday, Japanese crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin announced a hack or an ""unauthorized leak"" during which 4,502.9 bitcoin, valued at approximately 48.2 million yen, was stolen. That translates to roughly $308 million worth of bitcoin.

 DMM Bitcoin assured customers that their bitcoin deposits would be fully compensated through procurements supported by its group companies, although no timeline was provided. The theft occurred at 1:26 p.m. Tokyo time, coinciding with a 4,502-bitcoin transaction seen on the Bitcoin blockchain.

 In response, the exchange has halted crypto withdrawals, spot market purchases, and new leveraged trading positions, while also delaying yen-denominated withdrawals. DMM Bitcoin stated that further updates would be shared in a subsequent announcement. According to blockchain analytics provider Elliptic, this incident ranks as the eighth largest crypto exchange hack in history and the largest since the $477 million FTX theft in late 2022.

 A speculative surge drove up prices for some meme tokens and GameStop (GME) shares on Monday just hours after renowned retail trader Keith Gill, famous for the 2021 GME short squeeze, disclosed his latest bet on the stock. Using his ""DeepF---ingValue"" alias on Reddit, Gill shared his GME options positions on the r/Superstonk subreddit, revealing bets worth more than $115 million in shares and $65 million in call options expiring June 21.

 Gill also goes by RoaringKitty on YouTube and his most recent viral post triggered a rally, with cat-themed meme tokens such as POPCAT and MOG. Meanwhile, the unrelated GME meme coin on the Solana network soared roughly 200%. Gill’s social media activity previously sparked similar rallies in May, emphasizing his significant influence and market impact since his initial GameStop analysis in 2019, which culminated in the January 2021 short squeeze.

 While bitcoin has been in a sustained bull market throughout the year, the so-called altseason, referring to a rally in altcoins or non-bitcoin tokens, hasn't materialized yet. However, the frenzy around meme tokens shows that there is still plenty of speculation taking place in the crypto market outside of bitcoin. Of course, it's worth noting that trading small-capitalization tokens in the crypto market often amounts to nothing more than gambling.

 The past week has been a wild ride for the price bitcoin (BTC).

 The price of bitcoin fell below $67,000 on Tuesday ahead of May inflation data and the Federal Reserve's meeting. Bitcoin regained some ground on Wednesday before tumbling again on Friday. While other risk assets such as stocks bounced back on cooler-than-expected inflation data, bitcoin failed to claw back the losses.

 Despite bitcoin's performance last week, crypto is having a moment on the U.S. presidential election campaign trail. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump met with bitcoin miners last week and a leaked email showed members of President Joe Biden's adminstration will meet with members of the crypto community.

 Elsewhere, Terraform Labs has agreed to a massive $4.5 billion settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the TerraUSD stablecoin disaster from 2022, and an investigative report concluded that Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao is one of the top 25 richest people in the world.

 Former President Donald Trump has shifted his stance on cryptocurrencies during the current election cycle, now actively courting the crypto community to gain an edge over rivals Joe Biden and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

 After meeting with bitcoin miners at his Mar-a-Lago estate, Trump urged cryptocurrency enthusiasts on his Truth Social platform to ""vote for Trump,"" positioning himself as a defender against what he calls ""Biden's hatred of Bitcoin.""

 This new approach follows Trump's previous strong criticism of cryptocurrencies during his presidency, where he labeled them as highly volatile and unregulated assets that facilitate illegal activities. Now, however, Trump's campaign has announced plans to accept cryptocurrency donations, aiming to mobilize a ""crypto army"" to secure his election victory.

 On the other side of the aisle, the Biden Administration's approach to Bitcoin and crypto has come under fire, especially with a recent veto on legislation supporting crypto custody by financial institutions and proposed taxes on Bitcoin mining. According to a report in The Block, Biden is also expected to start accepting campaign contributions via crypto.

 People in Biden's camp will reportedly be attending a Bitcoin and blockchain roundtable next month, according to Bitcoin Magazine.

 Last Wednesday, a court filing revealed that Terraform Labs consented to a nearly $4.5 billion settlement to resolve a lawsuit from the SEC. The filing requested court approval for the settlement, which would put an end to a legal battle over the company's role in the dramatic failure of TerraUSD in May 2022 that led to an estimated $40 billion loss for investors.

 The settlement comprises roughly $3.5 billion in disgorgement, over $460 million in prejudgment interest, and $420 million as a civil penalty. Former CEO Do Kwon will also personally contribute over $200 million to the Terraform bankruptcy estate and is barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company.

 This agreement, originally reached ahead of a May 29 hearing, aims to impose substantial financial remedies and facilitate swift recovery for investors. The SEC highlighted that these penalties are intended to deter future fraudulent activities in the cryptocurrency market. Terraform Labs declared bankruptcy earlier this year, just before its trial with the SEC, where it was found guilty of defrauding investors.

 Since his imprisonment, Binance founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao has seen a significant increase in his net worth.

 Forbes now estimates Zhao’s fortune is $61 billion, making him the world's 24th richest person.

 This rise comes from his 90% stake in Binance, valued at $33 billion. Zhao stepped down as CEO of the company in November 2023 as a result of a plea deal with the U.S. Department of Justice. Despite the company's legal challenges and a $4.3 billion fine, Zhao's personal financial impact was limited to a $50 million fine. Since then, Binance has continued to grow, with its market share rising to 42% from 38% before Zhao's departure.

 A major boost to Zhao’s wealth comes from his holdings in Binance Coin (BNB). Forbes estimates he owns around 94 million tokens, which is 64% of all BNB tokens. Despite Binance’s legal troubles, BNB has surged by 100% in 2024, reaching a market cap of $110 billion.

 Binance’s initial coin offering in 2017 was undersubscribed, and forensic analysis indicates Zhao and Binance retained a significant portion of the unsold tokens. Currently, BNB trades heavily on Binance’s platform, and the token's performance has continued to add billions to Zhao’s net worth, even as he serves his sentence.

 All eyes are on the bitcoin price this week, as digital asset investment products, which include U.S.-based bitcoin ETFs, experienced more than $600 million in outflows amidst bitcoin's price drop last week, according to CoinShares.

 Despite the price drop, the notorious bitcoin bulls at MicroStrategy (MSTR) announced another $500 million convertible note offering for the purpose of purchasing more bitcoin before updating the offering to $700 million later in the week.

 While bitcoin has traded in a relatively narrow range this month, the crypto asset has been outperformed by several bitcoin mining stocks, as noted by a JPMorgan report. This is thought to be a response to Core Scientific's (CORZ) deal with CoreWeave related to artificial intelligence.

 The SEC's approval of spot ether ETFs also now appears to be an issue of ""when"" rather than ""if."" SEC Chair Gary Gensler indicated in a Senate hearing last week that the matter will be resolved over the summer. Additionally, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas gives a 50-50 chance that the approval will take place by July 2. Prediction market Polymarket puts chances of a spot ether ETF trading by July 4 at 75%.

Her heart pounded 200 beats per minute; her blood pressure spiked into hypertensive crisis; her skull throbbed. “It felt like my head was in a pressure vise being crushed,” she says. “That pain was worse than childbirth.”
Rosenkranz’s migraine lasted for five days. Doctors gave her several rounds of IV medication and painkiller shots, but nothing seemed to knock down the pain, she says. This was odd, especially because local doctors were similarly vexed when Indigo, Rosenkranz’s 5-year-old daughter, was taken to urgent care earlier that year, screaming that she felt a “red beam behind her eardrums.”
It didn’t occur to Sarah that these symptoms could be linked. But in January 2024, she walked into a town hall in Granbury and found a room full of people worn thin from strange, debilitating illnesses. A mother said her 8-year-old daughter was losing her hearing and fluids were leaking from her ears. Several women said they experienced fainting spells, including while driving on the highway. Others said they were wracked by debilitating vertigo and nausea, waking up in the middle of the night mid-vomit. 
None of them knew what, exactly, was causing these symptoms. But they all shared a singular grievance: a dull aural hum had crept into their lives, which growled or roared depending on the time of day, rattling their windows and rendering them unable to sleep. The hum, local law enforcement had learned, was emanating from a Bitcoin mining facility that had recently moved into the area—and was exceeding legal noise ordinances on a daily basis.
Over the course of several months in 2024, TIME spoke to more than 40 people in the Granbury area who reported a medical ailment that they believe is connected to the arrival of the Bitcoin mine: hypertension, heart palpitations, chest pain, vertigo, tinnitus, migraines, panic attacks. At least 10 people went to urgent care or the emergency room with these symptoms. The development of large-scale Bitcoin mines and data centers is quite new, and most of them are housed in extremely remote places. There have been no major medical studies on the impacts of living near one. But there is an increasing body of scientific studies linking prolonged exposure to noise pollution with cardiovascular damage. And one local doctor—ears, nose, and throat specialist Salim Bhaloo—says he sees patients with symptoms potentially stemming from the Bitcoin mine’s noise on an almost weekly basis.
“I’m sure it increases their cortisol and sugar levels, so you’re getting headaches, vertigo, and it snowballs from there,” Bhaloo says. “This thing is definitely causing a tremendous amount of stress. Everyone is just miserable about it.” 
Not all data centers make noise. And industry insiders say they have a technical fix for the ones that do, which involves replacing their facilities’ loud air fans with much quieter liquid-based cooling solutions. But some of their touted methods, including “immersion cooling” in oil, are expensive and untested on a large scale.
A representative for Marathon Digital Holdings, the company that owns the mine, did not answer questions about health impacts, but told TIME that it is working to remove the noisy fans from the site. “By the end of 2024, we intend to have replaced the majority of air-cooled containers with immersion cooling, with no expansion required. Initial sound readings on immersion containers indicate favorable results in sound reduction and compliance with all relevant state noise ordinances,” they wrote in an email.
The number of commercial-scale Bitcoin mining operations in the U.S. has increased sharply over the last few years; there are now at least 137. Similar medical complaints have been registered near facilities in Arkansas and North Dakota. And the Bitcoin mining industry is urgently trying to push bills through state legislatures, including in Indiana and Missouri, which would exempt Bitcoin mines from local zoning or noise ordinances. In May, Oklahoma governor Kevin Stitt signed a “Bitcoin Rights” bill to protect miners and prevent any future attempts to ban the industry. 
While some Granbury residents are fiercely protesting the mine, many others feel powerless to alter the will of a company with legal, political, and financial might. And the data center industry at large is only growing more dominant, thanks to the twin forces of Bitcoin mining and AI, the latter which spends a vast amount of energy training generative models to find patterns in data sets. According to a recent report, data centers will use 8% of total U.S. power by 2030, up from 3% in 2022. And if operators continue to locate the centers near existing communities and prioritize profits above all else, then the story of Granbury could become the story of countless small towns across America.
Granbury sits about an hour southwest of Fort Worth in Hood County, which houses a mostly rural and Republican population of about 65,000 people. About a 15-minute drive south of Granbury’s charming historic town center—which includes a 19th-century opera house—lies a gas plant called Wolf Hollow II. Driving toward the plant on a windy, predawn morning in May, it rises out of the sky like an oil rig in a pitch-black ocean, lights ablaze. 
But the glowing gas plant never caused substantial issues for the local residents. Rather, the problems started when Constellation Energy, which operated the plant, signed a deal in 2021 to power a new Bitcoin mining facility that would sit directly on its lot. The new facility consisted of 163 squat metal boxes resembling shipping containers, which housed a total of over 30,000 computers. These computers started running in the summer of 2022, and seemed to be switched on all day and night. As of December 2023, the Granbury mine is owned by Marathon, one of the largest Bitcoin holders in the world.
The computers power a process called proof-of-work mining. Rather than relying on a central bank or governmental agency, Bitcoin is created, maintained, and guarded by watchdogs around the world known as miners, who prevent tampering through a complex cryptographic process and are rewarded with bitcoin for doing so. Bitcoin’s first supporters hoped that this new system would support a global digital currency that would bring freedom, financial fairness, and wealth to its adopters. 
But the system also requires an immense and ever-increasing amount of electricity. While Bitcoin’s first miners were solo operators often working out of their bedrooms, the industry is now dominated by a handful of billion-dollar corporations who operate industrial-size server farms across the globe. In the month of March 2024 alone, the Bitcoin mining industry generated a record $2 billion in revenue. 
Much of the American Bitcoin mining industry can now be found in Texas, home to giant power plants, lax regulation, and crypto-friendly politicians. In October 2021, Governor Greg Abbott hosted the lobbying group Texas Blockchain Council at the governor’s mansion. The group insisted that their industry would help the state’s overtaxed energy grid; that during energy crises, miners would be one of the few energy customers able to shut off upon request, provided that they were paid in exchange. After meeting with the lobbyists, Abbott tweeted that Texas would soon be the “#1 [state] for blockchain & cryptocurrency.” The following month, the Commissioners Court of Hood County approved the development of a cryptocurrency operation at Wolf Hollow. The owners promised local jobs and said that they would mostly use “stranded energy” that would otherwise go unused. 
For months during 2022, Granbury residents Nick and Virginia Browning sat in their front yard watching the new metal boxes of the massive facility be installed in the dirt across the road. “It layered our houses with dust. We haven’t gotten it all out yet,” Nick Browning, 82, says. 
The dust, it turns out, was just a prelude to the noise. In order to cool the machines, the site’s operators attached thousands of fans to the containers, which churned constantly, emitting a vicious buzz. As more machines were switched on, the noise sounded like a ceiling fan, then a leaf blower, then a jet engine. It consumed afternoon dog walks and revved through cloudless nights, vibrating the trailer homes of many of the low-income residents who live blocks from the facility. The noise floated miles down the winding Brazos river, through the lush golf courses in the gated community Pecan Plantation and past county lines.
At first, residents responded to the intrusion by vacating their porches, retreating inside, and turning up their fans and air conditioners to the max. But many still felt tremors in their beds—including Larry Potts, a 77-year-old retired pastor who lives up the road from the plant. Potts says he stopped sleeping and started losing hearing in both ears. In February, his heart gave out after another sleepless night; he was rushed to the hospital and kept alive by an external pacemaker. There, he was diagnosed with third degree atrioventricular block, hypertension, and depression. 
“I’m sick of this world and all this mess around here,” he says he told his wife that day, referring to the Bitcoin mine’s noise. “We moved out here for the peace and quiet. But this has made me want to go.” 
Some nearby residents say they haven’t been affected. But the number of strange medical emergencies in the area have piled up. In addition to Potts’ discharge papers, TIME reviewed medical records provided by several Granbury residents. Hospital notes from 72-year-old Geraldine Lathers’ three-day stay document new prescriptions for high blood pressure and vertigo. Jenna Hornbuckle, 38, lost hearing in her right ear and was diagnosed with heart failure; ear exams document her hearing loss along with that of her 8-year-old daughter Victoria, who contracted ear infections that forced doctors to place a tube in her ear. And Avari Burns, a 19-year-old cancer patient, says she suffered from crippling migraines at home—but whenever she went to a Fort Worth hospital for chemotherapy, the migraines subsided. 
Virginia Browning, 81, who can see the Bitcoin mine from her front yard, says she was taken to urgent care with violent vertigo after waking up one night mid-vomit. Browning says she gets so dizzy she can barely walk in a straight line, and that she rarely sleeps through the night. ""When they crank this thing,” she says shakily, “I’m wide awake.”
 “We’re living in a nightmare,” Sarah Rosenkranz says, sitting at a barbecue restaurant in downtown Granbury on an evening in May. As rock music blares from the speakers and other patrons chatter away, Rosenkranz pulls out her phone and clocks 72 decibels on a sound meter app—the same level that she records in Indigo’s bedroom in the dead of night. In early 2023, her daughter began waking up, yelling and holding her ears. Indigo’s room directly faces the mine, which sits about a mile and a half away. She soon refused to sleep in her own room. She then developed so many ear infections that Rosenkranz pulled her from school in March and learned how to homeschool her for the rest of the semester. 
Over grilled salmon and hush puppies, Rosenkranz shares that her family has been sleeping peacefully at an inn downtown for the last three days in order to get away from the noise. But the next morning, after returning home, she contracts yet another migraine that lands her in urgent care.
Dr. Bhaloo, the ENT doctor in Granbury, says he’s seen an uptick since the new year in patients whose ailments—including ringing in their ears, vertigo, and headaches—could be related to the mine. “These people here, they’re good country folks, and Bitcoin, to them, is almost a foreign alien thing,” he says. “They don’t understand it. And [the noise] is detrimental to their health and anxiety.” Dr. Stephen Krzeminski, another Granbury ENT, agrees. “Sonic damage is real, there’s no disputing that,” he says. Krzeminski says he believes the mine is causing “mental and physical” health issues. “Imagine if I had vuvuzela in your ear all the time,” he says.
The level of noise is appalling to Dr. Thomas Münzel, a German cardiologist who is a leader in the growing field of scientific researchers measuring the impact of urban and industrial noise on humans. For the last 15 years, Münzel has studied how transportation and urban noise, especially at night, can be debilitating stressors on the heart, brain, and cardiovascular systems. In one study, he exposed young, healthy students to noise events up to 63 decibels, and found that their vascular function diminished after just a single night. In other studies, he’s found that nighttime noise pollution directly leads to heart failure and molecular changes in the brain, which may lead to impaired cognitive development of children and make some people more prone to developing dementia. 
“The European Environmental Agency tells us that everything above 55 decibels is making us sick,” he says. The fact that the Granbury Bitcoin mine is emitting 70 or even 90 decibels on a nightly basis is “like torture,” he says. “The most spectacular cardiovascular diseases will develop. They have to stop the machines.”
Health effects have the potential to extend past the human residents of Granbury. Studies have shown that man-made noise pollution harms animals and wildlife, causing oxidative stress and memory loss in rodents, acute anxiety in dogs, and a decrease in forest growth. Shenice Copenhaver’s dog, Persephone, started going bald and developed debilitating anxiety shortly after the Bitcoin mine began operating four blocks away. Directly next door, Tom Weeks’ dog Jack Rabbit Slim started shaking and hyperventilating uncontrollably for hours on end; a vet placed him on the seizure medication Gabapentin. Rosenkranz’s chickens stopped laying eggs for months. And Jerry and Patricia Campbell’s centuries-old oak tree, which had served as the family’s hub and protector for generations of backyard family reunions and even a wedding, died suddenly three months ago. 
It’s nearly impossible to prove the Bitcoin mine directly caused the afflictions of these specific animals and plants. But as the strange anecdotes collect, they’ve added to the stress of a town that feels under siege from all directions. 
“I’ve lived in Texas all my life and I’ve never seen an oak tree be beautiful one year and die the next,” Jerry Campbell says on his lawn, beneath the tree’s gnarled, blackened limbs. “It’s so strange.”
Hood County Constable John Shirley has spent months trying to find his own solutions to a problem that at times seems supernatural. As a former member of the Oath Keepers, a far-right militia whose leaders were convicted of seditious conspiracy against the U.S. government, Shirley is a somewhat divisive figure in the town. But lately Shirley has been laser-focused on the mine—an issue he considers apolitical. “When you’ve got Greenpeace supporting the same cause as a former Oath Keeper, what weird episode of the Twilight Zone are we in?” he says, chuckling darkly. (Shirley resigned from the Oath Keepers before Jan. 6, 2021, due to “serious concerns” with the direction of the organization, he says.) 
On a listless May morning before the sun has risen, Shirley is sitting in his truck across the road from the mine. He is used to getting up at this hour, as he’s been taking decibel readings of the plant around the clock in order to write tickets against the mine’s operators for disorderly conduct. Shirley sticks his recorder out the window and the numbers on it flicker up and down as the roar washes over it. Eventually, the recorder caps out at 91 decibels, which the CDC estimates as roughly in between the output of a lawnmower and a chainsaw. 
This level of noise, the CDC writes, can cause hearing damage after two hours of exposure. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration advises that employees can only work in 90-decibel settings for eight hours a day and are required to wear ear protection. And Texas state penal code deems any noise above 85 decibels unreasonable. Over the course of 2024, Shirley has recorded a noise above 85 decibels coming from the plant more than 35 times. 
Technically there is federal mandate to regulate noise, which stems from the 1972 Noise Control Act—but it was essentially de-funded during the Reagan administration. This leaves noise regulation up to states, cities, and counties. New York City, for instance, has a noise code which officially caps restaurant music and air conditioning at 42 decibels (as measured within a nearby residence). Texas’s 85 decibels, in contrast, is by far the loudest state limit in the nation, says Les Blomberg, the executive director of the nonprofit Noise Pollution Clearinghouse. “It is a level that protects noise polluters, not the noise polluted,” he says. 
Ultimately, Constable John Shirley can’t stop the machines, because there is no state law forcing the operator of a noisy machine to turn it off. When Shirley writes a ticket for disorderly conduct, it merely triggers a $500 fine, as opposed to jail time or another punitive measure. Hood County can’t even pass a relevant noise ordinance law: only Texas cities, not counties, have the ability to do so. 
Shirley’s tickets now add up to a theoretical fine of $17,500 and counting. But that number is chump change for Marathon, which earned $165 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2024 and bragged to shareholders about “record earnings.” And the company is fighting back: They have requested a jury trial to overturn this low-level misdemeanor, which starts July 8. At a pre-trial hearing in May, the company arrived with a full team of lawyers. “To bring two or three full-suited attorneys to a justice of the peace court citation issue: I’ve never seen that,” says Patrick Ryan, a local lawyer who has consulted with Granbury community members about the possibility of a civil nuisance lawsuit. “They’re coming with both barrels.” 
A representative for Marathon declined several interview requests with TIME, saying that the company would refrain from commenting publicly until Constable Shirley’s “unwarranted” citations against the plant had been resolved. As Shirley sits outside the facility recording the pulsating drone, his nostrils flare, and his voice rises with impatience. “When I was a murder investigator and someone killed somebody, I had the law on my side,” he says. “With this, it’s like I'm swatting at a rhinoceros.” As he reads the decibel levels on his sound meter, a security guard from the facility steps out of his car and snaps pictures of Shirley’s truck in the dark.
The residents of Granbury feel they’ve been lied to. In 2023, the site’s previous operators, US Bitcoin Corp, constructed a wall around the mine almost 2,000 feet long and claimed that they had “solved the concern.” But Shirley says that the complaints from the community about the sound actually increased when the wall was nearing completion last fall. Since Marathon bought the facility outright in December, its hash rate, or potential computational power expended, has doubled. A Marathon representative, however, says that their rate of energy consumption has decreased from 225 megawatts of capacity to 115 since the company took ownership of the site.
As complaints mounted at the top of 2024, the company contended it did not know about the extent of the sound issues. “We are now the owners, but we are not the operator. USBTC is still the operator. Prior to the purchase, we were not aware of the noise issues,” a Marathon representative wrote to TIME in an email in January. “Now that we own the site and have been made aware of the issue, we are working to gather information and address the situation.” 
But documents show that Marathon provided a $67 million loan in May 2021 to the site’s first formal owners, Compute North, to build out the site’s infrastructure, and Marathon’s purchase agreement of the site, dated December 15, 2023, clearly mentions the existence of the $1.9 million “sound wall” built several months prior.
As community complaints reached a fever pitch earlier this year, Marathon held a meet-and-greet on March 29—Good Friday, which rubbed many people in Granbury’s deeply religious community the wrong way. For the handful of people that did show up, Marathon laid out a noise mitigation plan which included turning off idle fans, moving some containers into liquid cooling by April 2024, and installing vegetation and trees around the perimeter. 
In an emailed statement to TIME in late June, Marathon said that 58 air-cooled containers have been removed from the site, and pointed to a roadmap which vows to convert 50% of the site’s containers to immersion cooling by the end of the year. A representative for Constellation Energy, which owns the power plant that Marathon connects to, said in a statement that the company is “staying updated on [Marathon’s] efforts to respond to the concerns raised by neighbors… We will continue working closely with Marathon as they take actions to reduce their impacts.”
Marathon says that immersion cooling, in which computers are placed in tubs of oil, will largely fix the noise problem. But the technique has potential drawbacks, including the difficulty of regularly performing maintenance on a computer submerged in oil, says Kent Draper, the chief commercial officer of the Bitcoin and AI data center operator IREN. “Although it's been around for a long time in the industry, it's just not that widely adopted,” he says. 
Even Marathon expressed skepticism about its ability to convert its many machines to immersion technology in a 2023 year-end SEC Report. “There is a risk we may not succeed in developing or deploying immersion-cooling at such a large scale to achieve sufficient cooling performance,” the company wrote. 
In an email to TIME, Marathon wrote: “While we are confident in our ability to scale this new technology, it is our obligation, as a publicly traded company, to identify any potential risks from a financial perspective.”
Granbury community members are exploring political and legal avenues. A petition against the mine in Granbury and its “excessive and unhealthy noise” garnered 800 in-person signatures, and was brought by representatives to the Texas Republican state convention in San Antonio in May, with the hopes of gaining statewide support for some sort of ban. But two local elected officials, Nannette Samuelson and Shannon Wolf, say they tried to take the floor to stump for the issue, but weren’t given time to speak. Samuelson’s goal is now to pass resolutions in commissioners court prompting state senators to draft legislation.  
Any statewide legislation is sure to hit significant headwinds, because the very idea of regulation runs contrary to many Texans’ political beliefs. “As constitutional conservatives, they have taken our core values and used that against us,” says Demetra Conrad, a city council member in the nearby town of Glen Rose. 
Some community members are also exploring a potential civil nuisance suit against Marathon, in which they would seek an injunction against the company and/or damages. One affected woman, Cheryl Shadden—who has medically-documented hearing loss—has retained the nonprofit Earthjustice to examine potential litigative routes. Deputy managing attorney Mandy DeRoche says Earthjustice is exploring the possibility of taking its own sound readings near the site. The nonprofit has been involved in several lawsuits against crypto mining companies across the country. 
“Historically, Bitcoin miners go to the cheapest source of electricity with the least amount of regulation, and they do the cheapest thing possible,” DeRoche says. “It's one of the reasons why noise pollution from crypto mining tends to be so much worse than traditionally-operated data center operators.” 
As Bitcoin continues to gain value, miners are building progressively bigger operations, causing gas plants and other fossil fuel emitters to spring back into action. It is unclear whether states even have the energy capacity to support this new demand: In June, Texas lieutenant governor Dan Patrick tweeted that Texans “will ultimately pay the price” for the growth of crypto and AI data centers, writing that they “produce very few jobs compared to the incredible demands they place on our grid.” Regardless, Bitcoin lobbying groups are attempting to pass pro-Bitcoin-mining bills in state legislatures across the country, which would exempt similar operations from noise ordinances and local zoning laws. People have reported similar symptoms near Bitcoin mines in Arkansas and Williston, North Dakota. Ultimately, Granbury is just one canary of several in the proverbial mine. 
In the week before this article’s publication, two more Granbury residents suffered from acute health crises. The first was Tom Weeks, the owner of the hyperventilating dog. On July 2, Weeks, 64, rose after another sleepless night of listening to the mine and realized he couldn’t breathe. He was rushed to a Fort Worth hospital, where he was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism—a blood clot blocking his lungs—and hooked up to an oxygen tank. Weeks was supposed to testify against Marathon in the jury trial, but is now physically unable to do so. “This whole thing is an eye opener for me into profit over people,” Weeks says in a phone call from the ICU. 
The second person affected was the five-year-old Indigo Rosenkranz. On July 6, she suffered from a seizure and was taken to the emergency room, before being routed to a childrens’ hospital in Fort Worth for further testing. Her mother, Sarah, was terrified and now feels she has no choice but to get a second mortgage to move away from the mine. “A second one would really be a lot,” she says. “God will provide, though. He always sees us through.”
Correction, July 16
The original version of this story misstated when Marathon started operating the Granbury Bitcoin mine. It bought the mine in December 2023 but did not start operating it until early 2024. The story has also been updated to clarify how the mine's energy consumption has changed.

The bullish impact of the halving-led slowdown in bitcoin's (BTC) supply expansion tends to kick in after 100 days, new research by ETC Group shows.
Bitcoin mining reward halving is an inbuilt code that takes effect every four years or after 210,000 blocks are mined on the blockchain. The quadrennial event reduces the reward miners receive for validating transactions by 50 percent.
The primary goal is to control the supply of bitcoin and ensure it becomes scarce over time, unlike fiat currencies, which have ever-increasing supply (monetary inflation). Bitcoin's supply is capped at 21 million, and reward halving helps to manage how fast that limit is hit.
The first halving, implemented in 2012, reduced the per-block reward paid to miners to 25 BTC from 50 BTC. Over the next two halvings, the per-block supply fell to 6.25 BTC. The latest halving, implemented on April 20, reduced it further to 3.125 BTC.
The previous halvings paved the way for multi-fold price rallies, with most gains coming after the first 100 days.
""Today marks exactly 100 days after the Bitcoin Halving event on April 20. The market tends to have a short memory, but the halving-induced supply deficit should just start taking effect from now on,"" Andre Dragosch, head of research at ETC Group, said on X.
Dragosch reached that conclusion after scanning the performance data before and after the previous three halvings implemented in 2012, 2016, and 2020.
The study showed that the mean excess performance – the difference between performance X number of days after the halving and X before halving – increases significantly 100 days after the halving and becomes statistically significant, with ""T-values"" exceeding 2%.
The T-value is a statistical figure used in hypothesis testing to determine how far the sample mean is from the population mean, which is stabilized by the sample's variability.
""The key takeaway is that 100 days after the Halving, the performance difference becomes statistically significant (T-value > 2) and then becomes increasingly significant until around 400 days after the Halving,"" Dragosch told CoinDesk.
The chart shows that the mean excess performance rises above 100% from the 100th day after halving and eventually peaks into four figures.
It remains to be seen if history will repeat itself.

Former President Donald Trump, who once called bitcoin ""a scam,"" is now pitching himself as the pro-crypto presidential candidate.   ""You're going to be very happy with me,"" Trump said at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tennessee, on Saturday.   
""If crypto is going to define the future, I want [it] to be mined, minted and made in the USA,"" he told a room full of bitcoin enthusiasts. ""If bitcoin is going to the moon ... I want America to be the nation that leads the way.""   
Trump used his keynote address at the conference to announce that if elected, ""it will be the policy of my administration, the United States of America, to keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.""   
The speech was an about-face for Trump, who tweeted in 2019 that cryptocurrency ""is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity....""   
But in the past two years, Trump has bought and sold millions of dollars in digital assets.   
The former president's courting of the cryptocurrency industry is the latest step in his post-term pivot on digital assets.   
Over the last two years, he appears to have made a substantial amount of money buying and selling them. He sold NFTs featuring cartoon pictures of himself in various costumes – muscled superhero outfits, on the moon, in an all-leather rock n' roll getup – personally earning between $100,001 and $1 million in income from them, according to his 2022 financial disclosure form. 
In May, Trump became the first major-party presidential candidate to accept crypto donations. The Wall Street Journal recently reported he had raised about $3 million via 100 cryptocurrency donations through the end of June.   
He also appears to own a cryptocurrency portfolio worth nearly $8 million as of July 29, based on research from the blockchain data tracking group Arkham Intelligence. Of that, $3 million is in TrumpCoin, a Trump-branded digital token described on Crypto.com as ""supporting the Trump administration and its conservative followers and Patriots.""   
Trump even announced a limited edition run of ""Trump Crypto President"" Bitcoin-branded sneakers, just days after the Bitcoin Conference. High tops in the color ""Bitcoin Orange,"" priced at $499, quickly sold out.  
Trump shored up his connection to the tech industry — and their money — by picking JD Vance as his vice presidential nominee. Vance has deep ties in Silicon Valley which have already paid dividends. He formerly worked for billionaire investor Peter Thiel, who donated $15 million to Vance's 2022 campaign for Ohio's Senate seat.   
In June of this year, one month before Vance was announced as the VP pick, he helped organize a $12 million fundraiser for Trump, attended by mega-donors in the tech space. Venture capitalist Chamath Paldihapitiya, an early senior executive at Facebook, was there, as was David Sacks, a member of the so-called PayPal Mafia, which also includes Thiel and Elon Musk.   
America PAC, a Trump-supporting political fundraising group, has also been flooded with money from Silicon Valley leaders like Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale, Douglas Leone of Sequoia Capital, and crypto billionaires Cameron and Tyler Winkelvoss. On July 15, The Wall Street Journal reported that Elon Musk promised to donate $45 million per month to the super PAC, but Musk has since disputed that claim.   
Investors indicate they are donating to Trump based on their belief his presidency would result in looser regulation and much higher growth for their assets, according to a recent survey by AMBCrypto. That survey showed 80% out of nearly 10,000 investors said they believed bitcoin would hit an $80,000 valuation if Trump wins the presidency. As of July 31, a bitcoin is worth nearly $66,500.   
""It's becoming an interest group,"" said Alex Gladstein, coauthor of ""The Little Bitcoin Book: Why Bitcoin Matters for Your Freedom, Finances, and Future"" and one of Bitcoin 2024's speakers. ""You have the agricultural lobby, you've got the Israel lobby, you've got the oil lobby, you're going to have the bitcoin lobby. Welcome to the future.""   
Trump made big promises for his potential future administration during his keynote speech at the Bitcoin 2024 conference. He told the crowd he would establish a crypto and bitcoin presidential advisory council and pledged to make America a ""bitcoin mining powerhouse.""   
Trump also said he'd create a ""strategic bitcoin stockpile,"" which would be filled with some of the reportedly $5 billion worth of bitcoin the U.S. government is currently sitting on. The government acquired it through legal seizures from hackers and users of Silk Road, a black market on the dark web that sold everything from jewelry and books to hard drugs and pornography.   
""I'm laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world,"" Trump said to applause.  
The former president received a standing ovation when he promised to fire Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, with a fervor that surprised even Trump.   
""On Day One, I will fire Gary Gensler and appoint a new SEC chairman,"" Trump told the crowd. ""I didn't know he was that unpopular. Well, I— wow, I didn't know he was that unpopular. Let me say it again. On Day One, I will fire Gary Gensler!""    
Gensler has argued that trading digital assets should be held to the same rules and standards as stock and bond trading, which crypto fans vehemently oppose.   
""The crypto industry's record of failures, frauds, and bankruptcies is not because we don't have rules or because the rules are unclear,"" Gensler wrote in a May letter to Congress. ""It's because many players in the crypto industry don't play by the rules.""  
""Crypto people don't like Gensler,"" Gladstein said. ""I don't think he likes all these people printing free money and then not paying taxes or not being subject to regulation.""   
Crypto investor Adam Patterson, who also goes by the name Loudmouth, said Trump's comments on Gensler struck a nerve, ""because he knew that is something that really irritates and has really lagged the crypto community. [Gensler] was teaching bitcoin back at MIT, and then it's like he became the number one combative source against it.""   
It is unclear based on previous court cases whether a future President Trump would legally be permitted to remove Gensler from his position. Gensler's current five-year term ends in 2026.   
When Trump promised to commute the life sentence of Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road and an icon in the bitcoin community, the crowd began loudly chanting: ""Free Ross! Free Ross! Free Ross!""   
Silk Road was the first major marketplace to use a bitcoin-based payment system. The Justice Department said the website was ""used by thousands of drug dealers and other unlawful vendors to distribute hundreds of kilograms of illegal drugs and other unlawful goods and services to more than 100,000 buyers, and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars deriving from these unlawful transactions."" But his conviction on charges of narcotics trafficking, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiring to commit computer hacking and conspiring to commit money laundering have turned him into a crypto-martyr to some.  
Many of the event's attendees wore black T-shirts with white letters that read: ""Free Ross Day One.""  
While Trump appears to be saying all the right things for the crypto industry, some investors still sound cautious.   
The price of bitcoin dipped slightly while Trump was on stage Saturday but, following his speech, it rose to a near record-high, surpassing $70,000. By Tuesday, though, it had dropped more than 4%. That drop, according to crypto trackers, might have been because the U.S. government's transfer of over $2 billion of bitcoin, which appear to be from the Silk Road seizures, to a new wallet.  
""For most people this is our number one source of income,"" said Leslie Motta, chief operating officer of Gokhshtein Media, who attended Bitcoin 2024. ""We want politicians, we want people to tap into this realm that we're in and continue to build it and expand it. I think he [Trump] resonates in that way because, you know, he's strong.""  
Major crypto donors seem to agree. The gold mask-wearing ""Shibtoshi,"" an anonymous crypto billionaire and the CEO and founder of SquidGrow, was ushered by the Secret Service into the front row of the conference right before Trump's keynote.  
""Because of who I am in the space … the money that I'm known to possess, I feel that I need to protect my identity to protect my family,"" he told CBS from behind his geometric gold mask. ""Crypto is still the wild wild west.""  
While Shibtoshi may have been cautious about his identity, he was fully transparent about his reaction to Trump.   
""I love every word that he had to say,"" he said. ""When it comes to cryptocurrency, I mean everything that he was saying, as far as bringing crypto mining back here, freeing Ross. I mean that all resonates with me and everyone else in the space. He's a businessman. He understands that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a business, and it could be very lucrative to the United States if they are involved in it, maybe adopt it as a currency. There are ways that we can bring liquidity back to the United States, instead of losing liquidity to foreign nations.""  
Others admitted that after hearing his speech, they were left with some hesitation about the promises Trump laid out.   
Julie Kennis, who hosts an NFTs podcast and works with Motta at Gokhshtein Media, said she liked Trump's clear policy for easing regulations on the crypto industry but expressed ambivalence about his more ""racially charged"" comments. For example, during his speech Trump was dismissive about his grandchild speaking Chinese and mocked Elizabeth Warren for claiming Native American heritage, something he's done many times before. Kennis called the statements ""completely wrong.""  
""I would love to hear [Vice President Kamala Harris's] policy because I feel like crypto should have bipartisan support. It's a huge industry, it's a growing industry and people are working really hard to create fantastic businesses and ways to create wealth,"" said Kennis, who voted for Trump in the last two elections.  
Harris has yet to make a definitive statement on cryptocurrency in her role as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. Some believe she would continue Biden-era policies of crackdowns and increased regulation. However, even the Biden administration seems to be more open to discussions with the industry — in July, senior Biden adviser Anita Dunn met with crypto leaders in a meeting that was called ""productive.""  
While it remains to be seen whether Trump will get the crypto vote in November, he's raking in their money now. A cryptocurrency fundraiser held after Trump's speech in Nashville is said to have raised $25 million, according to David Bailey, who organized the Bitcoin conference and is the CEO of BTC Inc.   
""I think the big picture here is the increasing normalization of bitcoin in the world, on Wall Street, in Washington, at home,"" said Gladstein. ""It's no longer some niche thing on the internet.""

 Bitcoin (BTC) selling continued over the weekend, with the cryptocurrency plummeting nearly 15% over the last week, its largest seven-day decline since the collapse of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX in November 2022. The sharp downturn carried over into Monday's Asian session, taking bitcoin to its lowest level since February.

 The digital asset has come under pressure over the last week as investors abandon risk-on bets amid escalating tensions in the Middle East and employment data indicating that the U.S economy may be slowing more than previously thought.

 On the trading front, crypto analytics site Coinglass showed Bitcoin liquidations for long positions tallying nearly $200 million over the past two days, their highest level since early July, adding further downward pressure as brokers forcibly close over-leveraged trades arising from recent price fluctuations.

 Below, we take a closer look the legacy cryptocurrency’s chart and use technical analysis to identify key price levels that may come into play amid ongoing selling.

 Since topping out in mid-March, the pioneer cryptocurrency has oscillated within a wedge-like pattern, a chart formation that consists of two converging trendlines connecting a series of respective lower highs and higher lows. Typically, a wedge represents consolidation in an asset’s price before a trending move in the direction of an eventual breakout.

 Indeed, the price has broken below the pattern's lower trendline early in Monday's Asian session, a move that could lead to further falls in the week ahead. Moreover, the 50-day moving average sits poised to cross below the 200-day moving average to form an ominous death cross, a signal that predicts lower prices.

 Amid further selling in Bitcoin, investors should monitor four areas on the chart likely to remain in focus.

 Firstly, it’s worth watching if bulls can defend the wedge pattern’s lower trendline, which currently sits around $56,000. An intraday reversal to reclaim this level on Monday could suggest a possible bear trap.

 However, a decisive volume-backed breakdown below the pattern could see a fall to $47,000, a location on chart where the price could encounter support near the January peak that formed as part of Bitcoin's trending move between September 2023 and March this year.

 Ongoing selling could see the price revisit $40,000, a location where buyers may seek entry points near the prominent January swing low.

 Finally, a larger sell-off could trigger a drop to $35,000, where the cryptocurrency would likely find support from a period of price consolidation between late October and mid-November last year, shortly after the price climbed back above the 200-day MA.

As a lacklustre Democratic Presidential campaign has transformed into the Kamala Harris Show, Donald Trump’s reëlection bid has turned into the Crypto Show. After picking J. D. Vance, a former venture capitalist and cryptocurrency booster, as his running mate, Trump appeared at a Bitcoin conference in Nashville, where he promised to create a “strategic bitcoin stockpile” and turn the United States into “the bitcoin superpower of the world.” He also pledged that he would fire Gary Gensler, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who has criticized the crypto industry for a “record of failures, frauds, and bankruptcies,” and who is the nemesis of many crypto bros.
Of course, it’s richly comedic to see Trump, a technophobe who, in 2019, said that the value of bitcoin was “based on thin air,” now promoting himself as its biggest champion and trying to cash in on it politically and personally. At the Nashville event, according to CNBC, dozens of crypto boosters, including the Winklevoss twins and Kid Rock, paid five hundred thousand dollars apiece to attend a private roundtable with the former President. A few days later, a company that Trump owns listed online a “limited” run of gold sneakers emblazoned with a Bitcoin symbol and the words “TRUMP CRYPTO PRESIDENT.” The high-tops were listed at five hundred dollars per pair. (According to one report, they subsequently appeared on eBay at prices of up to twenty-five hundred dollars, with one listing tagged at $69,999.)
What could be more predictable? In 2022 and 2023, Trump issued a series of N.F.T. trading cards featuring drawings of him in superhero costumes. Earlier this year, the latest edition of cards was pulled from sale after their prices plunged. But, behind the familiar sight of Trump trying to pad his campaign war chest and enrich himself, there is a bigger and more consequential story unfolding. The crypto industry, having suffered a series of legal and regulatory setbacks in recent years, including the conviction and imprisonment of some of its leading figures, is making a determined effort to gain relief from S.E.C. oversight at the same time that it is making inroads into mainstream finance. (Earlier this year, Fidelity, BlackRock, Invesco, and other firms launched exchange-traded funds whose value is tied to the price of bitcoin.) If this industry maneuver succeeds—and it may well do so if Trump wins in November and Republicans sweep Congress—the long-term consequences could be calamitous.
To understand the current situation, it’s necessary to go back a couple of years, when the industry was in crisis. In December, 2022, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX and a major political donor, was arrested. Subsequently, he was convicted of defrauding FTX customers out of more than $1.7 billion and sentenced to twenty-five years in prison. In November, 2023, Changpeng Zhao, the founder and C.E.O. of Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, pleaded guilty to failing to counter money laundering on the exchange, and was sentenced to four months in prison.
The confirmation that criminality was at the heart of crypto trading was, of course, a big setback for the industry at large. But an even bigger threat came in the form of Gensler and his campaign to treat many crypto assets as investment securities, like stocks or bonds, which would make them subject to strict investor-protection laws and government oversight. The crypto industry had long argued that investing in crypto is more akin to buying commodities, such as precious metals and pork bellies, which are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a much smaller agency than the S.E.C. and one that historically has been less focussed on individual investors.
In September, 2022, Gensler said, in a speech in Washington, that he believed “the vast majority” of crypto tokens were securities, and he quoted Joseph Kennedy, the first head of the agency, who averred, “No honest business need fear the S.E.C.” In the following months, the S.E.C. sued some leading crypto firms, including Binance and Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange. The agency accused the two companies of operating unregistered securities exchanges, and other violations. The companies denied any wrongdoing and tried to get the cases dismissed before trial. In March of this year, a federal judge in New York ruled against Coinbase and said that most of the case could go ahead. In June, a judge in Washington, D.C., said that most of the Binance case could go ahead, too. Last December, a federal judge in New York said “there was no genuine dispute” that four crypto tokens sold by Terraform Labs, a South Korean crypto company, were securities under U.S. laws.
The S.E.C. has also suffered setbacks on that key issue. In July, 2023, a federal court in California ruled that XRP, a token created by the San Francisco-based crypto company Ripple Labs, wasn’t a security when it was sold to the public on a crypto exchange. And in June of this year, the S.E.C. closed an investigation into Ethereum, the second-biggest blockchain network after Bitcoin. But, in the main, the agency had made progress in the courts. “People in the crypto industry are doubling down on political contributions,” Dennis Kelleher, the president of the public-interest group Better Markets, told me. “They can see the trend of losing to the S.E.C. in court. The legal walls are closing in, and they want Congress to say digital assets are not securities, so the S.E.C. has no jurisdiction over them. That’s the big ask.”
The scale of crypto-industry donations is startling. According to Bloomberg, three crypto super PACs, including the biggest one, Fairshake, have raised a hundred and seventy million dollars from donors including Coinbase, Ripple, and the venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. The flood of crypto money isn’t just going to Trump’s Presidential campaign. It’s also going to House and Senate campaigns. And whereas most of it seems likely to be directed at defeating Democrats who have been critical of crypto, including Senator Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, and Senator John Tester, of Montana, some is also going to other Democrats.
In a primary election last week in Arizona’s Third Congressional District, Yassamin Ansari, a Democratic member of the Phoenix city council, whose campaign had been boosted by ads paid for by a crypto super PAC, defeated Raquel Teran, a former chair of the state Democratic Party. Given all the crypto cash that is sloshing around, it may not be a coincidence that more than a dozen House Democrats recently signed a letter to Jaime Harrison, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, asking the committee “to take a forward-looking approach to digital assets and blockchain technology.” It remains true, however, that the crypto industry’s biggest political boosters are Republicans.
After Trump’s appearance at the recent Bitcoin conference, Senator Cynthia Lummis, of Wyoming, announced that she is proposing legislation to establish a “strategic Bitcoin reserve,” made up of about a million bitcoins. (Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., another crypto booster, is also advocating for this.) Again, there is comedic value here. The crypto bros, many of whom style themselves as libertarians, often argue that one of the great things about Bitcoin is its independence from governments. Here comes a Republican senator proposing to spend more than sixty billion dollars of taxpayers’ money (given the current price of bitcoin) to acquire about five per cent of the entire stock of the cryptocurrency.
Under Trump’s more modest proposal, the U.S. government would simply hold on to all the bitcoins that it accumulates via seizures by law-enforcement agencies. What economic good would keeping hold of these bitcoins do? “The tangible benefit is that it will get bitcoin maxis to vote for Trump,” James Angel, a financial economist at Georgetown, told Wired. “If you believe in Trumpism, that would be the benefit.”
While many crypto bros would surely benefit if the U.S. government gave bitcoin and other crypto assets its imprimatur, the industry’s main goal is to bring crypto assets into the mainstream world of investing while keeping regulation of them as light as possible. Kelleher said that we’ve seen where this story leads. He reminded me that, in 2000, Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which effectively exempted from regulation certain financial derivatives: contracts whose value is tied to the price of an underlying asset. During the ensuing years, the issuance of mortgage derivatives, such as credit-default swaps, increased enormously. Many big banks ended up being financially exposed to them, sometimes unknowingly. When the real-estate market cracked, the value of the underlying mortgage securities collapsed, and the whole edifice came tumbling down, eventually prompting a taxpayer bailout.
A possible defense of crypto is that we’ve already been through a punishing collapse in the price of digital assets, and it didn’t have much impact on the broader financial system. (In 2021 and 2022, the value of bitcoin plunged by more than two-thirds.) But, as Kelleher also noted, that crash occurred in an environment where regulators had insisted that crypto and crypto assets be kept at arm’s length from the rest of the financial system. “Imagine if a crash happened when crypto was deregulated but also fully integrated and interconnected with the banking system,” Kelleher said. “There would be countless derivatives whose value was tied to the bitcoin price, and these liabilities would be all over the balance sheets of the banks. Then we’d be back to where we were in 2008.”
That may be the very worst-case scenario, but the larger point stands: we’ve seen the dangers of light-handed financial regulation. In the case of mortgage securities, at least the argument could be made that they were supposed to serve a larger social purpose: expanding homeownership. If anyone has discovered an overweening social purpose for cryptocurrencies and other crypto assets, they’ve kept it well hidden. But don’t try telling that to the Mar-a-Lago crypto convert. He’s got an election campaign to finance and some sneakers to sell. ♦

The leading cryptocurrency traded at around $59,600 on Monday morning, down 1.7% over the last 24 hours but up more than 2% in early morning trading. Bitcoin has had a rollercoaster few weeks. Early last week, in the midst of an anxiety-induced global stock sell-off, it plummeted to $50,000 from $70,000, before rebounding to $60,000 days later.
These moves have brought Bitcoin’s market capitalization to $1.18 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. In a rare divergence, Ethereum, the second most popular cryptocurrency, was up 0.2% in the last day, trading at just under $2,700. It has a market cap of $321 billion.
But other popular cryptocurrencies followed in Bitcoin’s footsteps. Solana was down 2.5%, Dogecoin fell 1.43%, and Cardano dipped 2.1%. This shaved $2.1 trillion off the  broader cryptocurrency market value.
With markets especially sensitive to economic news, Bitcoin could remain volatile. The latest U.S. Consumer Price Index reading is coming Wednesday, and Japan’s Producer Price Index drops  Tuesday. 
Corporate earnings are another key indicator of consumer and economic health. U.S. retailer Walmart and Chinese e-commerce site Alibaba are both set to report this week. The two giants’ results have the potential to be market-moving, as fears about the U.S. economy have begun to bubble to the surface.
Stocks went into a tailspin last Monday after July’s jobs report showed unemployment ticking up more than expected to its highest level in three years. Employers added just 114,000 jobs in July, falling far short of the 175,000 gain economists polled by FactSet had projected. Both pieces of news signaled to investors that attempts to wrangle inflation might have cooled the economy too much.
At the same time, the Bank of Japan raised its benchmark interest rate, causing the value of the yen to rise, sparking fears of “carry trades.” This is a trading strategy that involves borrowing with a currency at a low interest rate, like the yen, and using it to buy higher-returning investments.

Bitcoin
 and cryptocurrencies have been given a shot in the arm this year by first a huge Wall Street earthquake and then the surprise embrace of former president Donald Trump.

The bitcoin price surged back to over its previous all-time high earlier this year, topping $70,000 per bitcoin before falling back (though many still expect a bitcoin price boom before the end of 2024).
Now, after a leak primed the bitcoin and crypto market for a U.S. crackdown, iPhone maker Apple has announced a major change to its Apple Wallet—described by one crypto chief executive as a ""powerful"" update.

Apple has announced a major update that could see bitcoin and crypto used for Apple Wallet on iPhone ... More payment for the first time.
Apple has said it will begin letting third-party developers use the iPhone's near-field communication (NFC) payment chip to handle transactions following a multi-year pressure campaign from regulators in Europe for the company to open up the platform.
iPhone users will be able to choose a third-party payment app as their system default and possibly one that supports bitcoin, crypto, or stablecoin payment options. Stablecoins—the largest of which are Tether's USDT
Tether
 and Circle's USDC—are cryptocurrencies price-pegged to traditional currencies, usually the U.S. dollar.
""Tap to pay using USDC on iPhones incoming soon,"" USDC stablecoin developer Circle's chief executive Jeremy Allaire posted to X, telling wallet devs to ""start your engines.""
Allaire went on to explain what the update will mean for developers and point-of-sale (PoS) hardware/software companies and how they should prepare.
""This would allow a [point of sale] to tell an iPhone what blockchain address it will accept USDC on, or the amount to pay, and then the iPhone-based wallet app could prompt the user to confirm a payment (like with FaceID) and initiate a transaction over the blockchain to settle the USDC,"" Allaire said.

The bitcoin price has rocketed over the last year, topping its previous $70,000 per bitcoin all-time ... More high.
""Combining this with high-performance and low-fee blockchain networks (most these days), this will open up a powerful pathway for direct to merchant USDC payments.""
Apple will still require developers to pay ""associated fees"" to use the NFC chip and enter into a ""commercial agreement"" that means only ""authorized developers who meet certain industry and regulatory requirements and commit to Apple’s ongoing security and privacy standards"" can access the system.
Apple said it will roll out the program in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, the U.S. and U.K.—without mentioning the European Union, which has pushed hardest for the change.

 A new study showed the number of cryptocurrency millionaires nearly doubled in the past year as the number of people investing in digital currency increased and prices climbed.

 British investment migration consultancy Henley & Partners found 172,300 individuals held more than $1 million in crypto assets this year, 95% more than in 2023. The number of Bitcoin millionaires more than doubled, to 85,400.

 The report said there were 325 crypto centi-millionaires — those with $100 million or more, a 79% increase — and 28 crypto billionaires, a rise of 27%.

 An estimated 34% of 24–to-35-year-olds globally own crypto. This age group is by far the largest cohort of crypto holders, said Henry Burrows, founder of Hoptrail, a UK-based blockchain analytics firm.

 The total market value of crypto assets increased 89% to $2.3 trillion, Henley & Partners said.

 Dominic Volek, group head of private clients at the firm, said that along with soaring prices, the introduction of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) was a game-changer.

 “The cryptocurrency landscape of 2024 bears little resemblance to its predecessors,” he said. “Bitcoin’s rise to over USD 73,000 in March set a new all-time high, while the long-awaited approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the USA unleashed a torrent of institutional capital.”

 Over the past year, Bitcoin’s value more than doubled. The values of Ether and Dogecoin were up about 50%.

So does a group of tech entrepreneurs backed by big Silicon Valley money. And they love it.
Imagine if you could choose your citizenship the same way you choose your gym membership. That’s a vision of the not-too-distant future put forward by Balaji Srinivasan. Balaji – who, like Madonna, is mostly just known by his first name – is a rockstar in the world of crypto. A serial tech entrepreneur and venture capitalist who believes that pretty much everything governments currently do, tech can do better.
I watched Balaji outline his idea last autumn, at a vast conference hall on the outskirts of Amsterdam. “We start new companies like Google; we start new communities like Facebook; we start new currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum; can we start new countries?” he asked, as he ambled on stage, dressed in a slightly baggy grey suit and loose tie. He looked less like a rockstar, more like a middle manager in a corporate accounts department. But don’t be fooled. Balaji is a former partner at the giant Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. He has backers with deep pockets.
Silicon Valley loves “disruption”. Tech startups have been disrupting traditional media for years; now they are making inroads into other areas too: education, finance, space travel. “Imagine a thousand different startups, each of them replacing a different legacy institution,” Balaji told the audience. “They exist alongside the establishment in parallel, they’re pulling away users, they’re gaining strength, until they become the new thing.”
If startups could replace all these different institutions, Balaji reasoned, they could replace countries too. He calls his idea the “network state”: startup nations. Here’s how it would work: communities form – on the internet initially – around a set of shared interests or values. Then they acquire land, becoming physical “countries” with their own laws. These would exist alongside existing nation states, and eventually, replace them altogether.
You would choose your nationality like you choose your broadband provider. You would become a citizen of the franchised cyber statelet of your choice.
There is nothing new about corporations having undue influence in the affairs of nation states. The term ""banana republic"" derives from the fact that a US company, United Fruit, effectively ruled Guatemala for decades beginning in the 1930s. Apart from owning the majority of the land, they ran the railways, the postal service, the telegraph. When the Guatemalan government tried to push back, the CIA helped United Fruit out by instigating a coup.
But the network state movement appears to have greater ambitions still. It doesn’t just want pliant existing governments so that companies can run their own affairs. It wants to replace governments with companies.
The Coming Storm

As the US heads into a presidential election, Gabriel Gatehouse dives back into the labyrinthine rabbit warren of American conspiracy culture. Whilst liberals across the world worry about a possible return of Donald Trump, millions of Americans are convinced that their democracy has already been hijacked – by a sinister Deep State cabal. How did this happen? And who is behind it? That's the story that Gabriel Gatehouse is investigating in this series of The Coming Storm.
There are those who view the network state idea as a neo-colonial project that would replace elected leaders with corporate dictators acting in the interests of their shareholders. But others think it's a way of cutting through what they see as the regulation-infested state of Western democracies today. Sounds like a tech bro fantasy? Elements of the network state already exist.
The conference in Amsterdam included tech entrepreneurs showcasing some of these “startup societies”. There was Cabin, a “network city of modern villages” that has branches in the US, Portugal and elsewhere; and Culdesac, an Arizona-based community designed for remote working.
Balaji’s concept of the network state builds on the idea of “charter cities”, urban areas that constitute a special economic zone, similar to free ports. There are several such projects under construction around the world, including in Nigeria and Zambia. At a recent rally in Las Vegas, Donald Trump promised that, if elected in November, he would free up federal land in Nevada to “create special new zones with ultra-low taxes and ultra-low regulation”, to attract new industries, build affordable housing and create jobs. The plan would, he said, revive “the frontier spirit and the American dream”.
Culdesac and Cabin look more like online communities that have established territorial bases. Próspera is different. Located on an island off the coast of Honduras, it describes itself as a “private city” catering to entrepreneurs. It promotes longevity science – offering unregulated experimental gene therapies to slow the ageing process.
Run by a for-profit company based in Delaware in the United States, Próspera was granted special status under a previous Honduran government to make its own laws. The current president, Xiomara Castro, wants it gone, and has begun stripping it of some of the special privileges it was granted. Próspera is suing the government of Honduras for $10.8 billion.
At some point during the day-long pitching session in Amsterdam, a young man in a grey hoodie slouched on stage. His name was Dryden Brown. He said he wanted to build a new city-state, somewhere on the Mediterranean coast. It would be governed not by a giant state bureaucracy, but on the blockchain, the technology underlying cryptocurrency. Its founding principles would be ideas of “vitality” and “heroic virtue”. He called it Praxis, the Ancient Greek word for “action”. The first citizens of this new nation, he said, would be able to move in in 2026.
He was a little hazy on the details. Move in where exactly? Who would build the infrastructure? Who would run it? Dryden Brown fumbled with a remote and pulled up a slide, suggesting Praxis was backed by funds with access to hundreds of billions of dollars of capital.
For now, though, the “Praxis community” exists mainly on the internet. There is a website where you can apply for citizenship. Who, exactly, these citizens are, is unclear. Dryden flashed up another slide with his remote. It was a Pepe meme: the sad-looking cartoon frog that became an “alt-right” mascot during the Trump campaign in 2016.
In this niche world of startup nations, Praxis had a reputation for edginess. They hosted legendary parties: people spoke of candle-lit soirees in giant Manhattan loft spaces, where awkward computer coders mixed with hipster models and figures from the “Dark Enlightenment” – people like the blogger Curtis Yarvin, who advocates a totalitarian future in which the world is ruled by corporate “monarchs”. His ideas are sometimes described as fascist, something he denies. Attendees would be made to sign an NDA. Journalists were generally not welcome.
After his presentation, I went to talk to Dryden Brown. He seemed suspicious and a little cold, but he gave me his phone number. I messaged him a few times, trying to engage him in conversation. To no avail.
But then, about six months later, I spotted an intriguing notice on X. “Praxis magazine launch. Tomorrow night. Photocopy your favourite pages.” There was no time given, no location. Just a link where you could apply to attend. I applied. No answer. So, next morning, I texted Dryden Brown again. And to my surprise, he replied right away: “Ella Funt at 10pm.”
Ella Funt turned out to be a bar and nightclub in Manhattan. Formerly known as Club 82, it had once been a legendary spot on the New York gay scene; in the 1950s, writers and artists would go there to drink cocktails served by women in tuxedos and watch drag acts in the basement. Now it was hosting an exclusive party for people who wanted to start a new country. And I had somehow got myself an invite. But I was 2000 miles away in Utah. If I was going to make it in time, I had to get on a flight right away.
I was actually one of the first to arrive. The place was almost empty, with a few Praxis people laying out copies of their magazine around the bar. I flicked through it: expensive, heavy paper; lots of advertisements for seemingly random things: perfume; 3D-printed guns; one for just… milk. Like Pepe the Frog, milk is an internet meme. In “alt-right” circles, posting an icon of a white milk bottle signals white supremacy.
The magazine urged readers to “photocopy pages and paste them around your town” – a kind of analogue memetics. A Xerox machine had been wheeled into the bar for that very purpose.
A group of young men walked in, some wearing cowboy boots. They didn’t look like outdoor types though. I got talking to one of them. He introduced himself as Zac, a “crypto cowboy” from Milton Keynes (he was wearing a leather Stetson.)
“I kind of represent the American Wild West,” he said. “I feel as though we are at the frontier.”
Plenty of people associate cryptocurrencies with scams: highly volatile internet money, the value of which could disappear overnight. But in the world of the “network state”, they love crypto. They see it as the future of money – money that governments cannot control.
The next person I got talking to called himself Azi. I asked for his surname. “Mandias,” he replied with a smile. It was a reference to a sonnet by Percy Bysse Shelley: Ozymandias, King of Kings. Anonymity is an important part of the crypto ethos. I got the feeling no one at this party was giving me their real names.
Mr Mandias was from Bangladesh originally, but had grown up in Queens, New York. He was the founder of a tech startup. He believed that, just as the printing press had contributed to the collapse of the feudal order in Europe 500 years ago, today new tech – crypto, the blockchain, AI – would bring about the collapse of the democratic nation state.
“Obviously, democracy is great,” he said. “But the best ruler is a moral dictator. Some people call [that] the philosopher king.”
Azi said he was excited to be “on the precipice of what I think is the next renaissance”. But before this renaissance, he predicted a “Luddite movement” against new technology that would destroy millions of jobs and monopolise the global economy. The Luddites would fail, Azi said. Yet he predicted that the transition period to what he called the “next stage” of human societal evolution – the “network state” stage – would be violent and “Darwinistic”.
Far from being perturbed by this prospect, Azi seemed excited at the thought that out of the smouldering ashes of democracy, new kings would emerge: corporate dictators ruling over their networked empires.
I wandered over to the bar and got myself a drink. There I got talking to two young women who did not look like they were part of the crypto crowd. Ezra was the manager of another nightclub nearby, her friend Dylan was a student. It looked like they’d been invited to add a bit of glamour to what was – essentially – a party of crypto-bros and computer geeks. But they had some thoughts about the whole network state idea.
“What happens if you don't have enough employees in the hospital or at the school for the kids?” Dylan asked. “It is unrealistic to start an entire city without any government.” To Ezra, the whole idea seemed dystopian. “We wanted to see what a ‘real’ cult meeting was like,” she said, I think in jest.
Just then, Dryden Brown appeared, the co-founder of Praxis. When he went outside for a cigarette, I followed him. The Praxis Magazine was a way to showcase the new culture he was hoping to build, he told me. Praxis, he said, was about “the pursuit of the frontier” and of “heroic virtue”.
I doubted Dryden would last very long in a covered wagon out on the prairie. He looked exhausted by it all. I wanted to ask him some pointed questions about the network state project: who would be the citizens of this brave new world? Who would govern it? What was with all the alt-right memes? And – Dylan’s question – who was going to staff the hospitals?
But we kept getting interrupted by more guests arriving. Dryden Brown invited me to visit the “Praxis Embassy” the following day. We said our see-you-tomorrows and went inside. The party was getting wilder. Ezra and Dylan and some friends who looked like models were climbing up on top of the Xerox machine. They were busy photocopying – not pages from the magazine, but bits of their bodies. I grabbed a copy of the magazine and left.
Back at my tiny Airbnb above a Chinese supermarket, I leafed through it. Alongside the white supremacist memes and ads for guns, there was a QR code. It linked to a short film: a 20-minute polemic against the emptiness of modern life, a lament for a vanished world of hierarchies and heroism.
“You are entertained and satiated,” the narrator intones, “you are seemingly productive. But you are not great.” The voice talks about the “algorithms making you hate yourself and your own civilisation”.
At this point in the film, the screen shows an animated figure pointing a pistol straight at the viewer.
“Contemporary media proclaims that having any ideals is fascist,” the voice continues. “Everything of conviction is fascist.”
Was it an invitation to embrace the label of fascism? This movement seemed to yearn for a specific conception of Western culture - a Nietzschean world in which the fittest survive, where disruption and chaos give birth to greatness.
The next day, I stopped by the “Praxis Embassy” – a giant loft space on Broadway. The bookshelves were indeed filled with copies of Nietzsche, biographies of Napoleon and a volume entitled The Dictator’s Handbook. I hung around for a bit, but Dryden Brown never turned up.
I left wondering what exactly it was I had witnessed the previous night: was it a glimpse of the future, in which countries like the United States and the UK would collapse into a spider’s web of corporate societies, a world in which you could choose to become a citizen of a cyber statelet? Or were Dryden Brown and his friends just “trolling”, a bunch of tech bros roleplaying as alt-right revolutionaries in order to have a laugh at the expense of the establishment, and enjoy a good party?
Might Dryden Brown one day become a CEO-king, ruler of an alt-right franchised empire with outposts dotted around the Mediterranean? I doubt it. But there are moves to promote more autonomous zones, free ports and charter cities. And if democracy is in trouble, the network state movement looks like it is waiting in the wings.

                    Bitcoin came close to its all-time-high price of $73,577.21 [File]

Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, hit a price of around $73,544 early on October 30, coming less than $500 short of the all-time-high price of $73,750.07 that the coin hit in March this year, according to CoinMarketCap.
The leading cryptocurrency is up by 111.46% in the past one year, after starting 2024 in the $42k range. 
The rise in price is a moment of excitement for crypto users across the world who are investing in a bull market and the coin’s ascent. 
However, investors who used the WazirX exchange are unable to take part in this, as their crypto funds have been locked since a cyberattack against the exchange in July that led to the loss of more than $230 million.
After the cyberattack and subsequent crypto withdrawal freeze, WazirX has applied for a moratorium through the Singapore courts to protect it from legal action as it pushes for restructuring.
In the Telegram group ‘Justice for WazirX Users,’ with over 2,000 members ranging from investors to well-wishers and legal agents, many expressed their distress at being unable to access their crypto during such a crucial time.
Others hoped they would be able to recover at least 55% of their assets after the restructuring, while some were unclear as to whether a bear market or a bull market would result in better recoveries for them.
The volatile nature of crypto prices makes it especially difficult to calculate how investors should be compensated after incidents such as hacks.
WazirX has shared a tentative scheme timeline to help users understand when different parts of the restructuring proceedings will move forward. Meanwhile, the true cause of the hack is not yet confirmed as WazirX and digital custody services provider Liminal blamed each other.
“While WazirX is dedicated to progressing as quickly as possible, certain phases depend on Singapore court schedules, particularly during the holiday season,” said the company, which is still embroiled in a separate dispute regarding its business relationship with the international crypto exchange Binance.
Though the WazirX withdrawal freeze took place on July 18 this year, the effective date of restructuring - for the time being - is February 3 next year, leaving many users angry and upset at the thought of missing out on key market changes for months on end.
In the meantime, a WazirX creditor outreach townhall is scheduled for November 22.

The price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies soared on Monday, extending a rally set off last week by the reelection of former  President Donald Trump.
Bitcoin climbed nearly 11% in value in early trading on Monday, hitting a record high as it surged past $87,000 for the first time ever. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, jumped 5.5%.
The euphoria also lifted lesser-known coins. The price of litecoin increased more than 4%, while dogecoin climbed almost 25%.
""They've been collectively on a tear,"" Katie Stockton, the founder of market research firm Fairlead Strategies, told ABC News. ""Much like bitcoin, we've seen breakouts across the cryptocurrency markets.""
The digital asset boom appears to reflect investor enthusiasm about Trump, who has vowed to bolster the cryptocurrency sector and ease regulations enforced by the Biden administration, experts told ABC News.
In July, Trump told the audience at a cryptocurrency conference in Nashville, Tennessee, that he wanted to turn the U.S. into the ""crypto capital of the planet.""
Trump promised to weaken federal oversight of cryptocurrency and establish the federal government's first National Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.
Trump also said he would replace Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, whom many crypto proponents dislike for his robust approach to crypto regulation.
""Crypto has moved a lot since the election, and to me that's on the news of a changing regulatory environment,"" Bryan Routledge, a professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business, told ABC News.
The growth in cryptocurrency prices on Monday far outpaced the U.S. stock market performance. In early trading, the S&P 500 ticked up 0.25%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.75%, or about 330 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq increased just 0.1% in early trading on Monday.
The sharp run-up of bitcoin prices marked a breakthrough for the world's largest cryptocurrency. However, the recent rise follows a period of stellar returns that stretches back to last year. The price of bitcoin has soared 122% since November 2023.
Those gains have been propelled in part by U.S. approval in January of Bitcoin ETFs, or Exchange-Traded Funds. Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to buy into an asset that tracks the price movement of bitcoin, while avoiding the inconvenience and risk of purchasing the crypto coin itself.
""If you look at how the price of bitcoin has moved a lot over the last year, the rise over the last week is a bit stunning but the rise over the last year has been five times as stunning,"" Routledge said.
The crypto industry entered this year bruised after a series of high-profile collapses and company scandals.
FTX, a multi-billion-dollar cryptocurrency exchange co-founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, collapsed in November 2022. The implosion set off a 17-month legal saga that resulted in the conviction of Bankman-Fried for fraud. In April, Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison.
Changpeng Zhao, the founder and former CEO of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance, was sentenced to four months in prison in April after pleading guilty to charges that his platform had enabled illicit financial activity.
The prolonged recovery of cryptocurrency in recent years has proven remarkable but it also stands amid volatility that has typified digital assets since the founding of bitcoin in 2009, David Yermack, a professor of finance at the New York University Stern School of Business, told ABC News.
""It can drop and it can go up very, very quickly,"" Yermack said. ""It's extraordinarily volatile.""
Cryptocurrency will likely remain highly volatile even if Trump eases regulations, experts said.
Since cryptocurrency has not gained wide adoption as a means of facilitating exchange, the asset primarily serves as a store of value, akin to gold, Routledge said. Such assets sometimes demonstrate sharp increases in value due to a favorable economic environment, but they also carry substantial risks, Routledge said.
""We don't use cryptocurrency to buy coffee,"" Routledge said. ""It serves as digital gold. Those types of assets tend to be fairly volatile.""

NEW YORK (AP) — As money continues to pour into crypto following Donald Trump’s reelection last week, bitcoin has climbed to yet another record high.
The world’s largest cryptocurrency topped $89,000 for the first time, briefly peaking at $89,995 early Tuesday, according to CoinDesk. Bitcoin’s price oscillated throughout the day, but is still up more than 27% over the last week — standing at about $88,288 as of 5 p.m. ET.
That’s part of a rally across cryptocurrencies and crypto-related investments since Trump won the U.S. presidential election. Analysts credit much of the recent gains to an anticipated “crypto-friendly” nature of the incoming administration, which could translate into more regulatory clarity but also leeway.
Still, as with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is hard to predict. And while some are bullish, others continue to warn of investment risks.
Here’s what you need to know.
Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now, but has come under the spotlight in recent years.
In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority — meaning it’s typically not backed by any government or banking institution — and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain. 
Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a “digital alternative” to traditional money — but it can be very volatile, and reliant on larger market conditions.


A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of last week’s election. 
Trump was previously a crypto skeptic, but changed his mind and embraced cryptocurrencies during this year’s presidential race. He has pledged to make the U.S. “the crypto capital of the planet” and create a “strategic reserve” of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.
Crypto industry players welcomed Trump’s victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they’ve long lobbied for. And Trump had previously promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government’s crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.
“Crypto rallied as Election Day progressed into the night and as it became increasingly clear that Trump would emerge victorious,” Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a Friday research note, pointing to larger industry sentiment around Trump being “crypto-friendly” and a potential shift in regulatory backing.
But even before the post-election rally, assets like bitcoin posted notable gains over the past year or so. Much of the credit goes to early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January. 
Inflows into spot ETFs, or exchange-traded funds, “have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,” Glass and Saunders noted. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.
In April, bitcoin also saw its fourth “halving” — a preprogrammed event that impacts production by cutting the reward for mining, or the creation of new bitcoin, in half. When that reward falls, so does the number of new bitcoins entering the market. And, if demand remains strong, some analysts say this “supply shock” can also help propel the price long term.
Crypto assets like bitcoin have a history of drastic swings in value — which can come suddenly and happen over the weekend or overnight in trading that continues at all hours, every day.
In short, history shows you can lose money as quickly as you’ve made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions.
At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. Then came the 2022 collapse of FTX, which significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall.
At the start of last year, a single bitcoin could be had for less than $17,000. Investors, however, began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool — and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. While some crypto supporters see the potential for more record-breaking days, experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors. 
“Investors should only dabble in crypto with money that they can be prepared to lose,” Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said last week. “Because we’ve seen these wild swings in the past.”
Assets like bitcoin are produced through a process called “mining,” which consumes a lot of energy. And operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.
Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth’s Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin’s electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).
In the U.S., the Energy Information Administration notes that crypto mining across the country has “grown very rapidly over the last several years,” adding that grid planners have begun to express concern over increases in related electricity demand. Preliminary estimates released by the EIA in February suggest that annual electricity use from crypto mining probably represents between 0.6% to 2.3% of U.S. electricity consumption.
Environmental impacts of bitcoin mining boil largely down to the energy source used. Industry analysts have maintained that clean energy has increased in use in recent years, coinciding with rising calls for climate protections from regulators around the world.

Bitcoin surged to a record high of $89,000 on Tuesday as investors pumped money into cryptocurrencies following the election of Donald Trump as United States president, who has turned from a cypto-sceptic to an investor himself.
Bitcoin, the oldest and the largest crypto currency, has seen its value go up by 30 percent in the past week. It is not the only cryptocurrency on the move. Since Trump’s victory, Dogecoin — a currency backed by Trump ally Elon Musk — has surged 152 percent.




Cryptocurrency is a “digital alternative” to traditional money and works online without a central authority. But it has long also been very volatile and has faced government curbs in several parts of the world.
So how is the crypto spike linked to Trump’s election and will the new US administration ease regulatory frameworks around crypto?
Analysts believe Trump’s embrace of cryptocurrencies during the presidential campaign and his venture into crypto trade is luring investors on the expectation that the new administration would be crypto-friendly.
The Trump campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he also appeared at industry events, promising to make the US “the crypto capital of the planet”.
In late September, Trump and his three sons – Donald Jr, Eric, and Barron – unveiled his latest entrepreneurial endeavour, World Liberty Financial. Billed as a decentralised finance (DeFi) money market platform, this new venture introduced a proprietary cryptocurrency dubbed $WLFI.
Although details of the new venture are unclear, many pro-crypto enthusiasts see this as a nod of support for digital currencies from the incoming Trump administration.
The venture has drawn criticism from some experts in the DeFi sector for possible conflicts of interest and the fact that the venture was launched during the 2024 presidential campaign.
In a recent interview with Newsweek magazine, Michael Dowling, professor of finance at the Dublin City University Business School, stated: “There have been such a parade of undesirables in the crypto and DeFi world that adding Trump to the list couldn’t possibly push the needle on popularity or enthusiasm. Bear in mind these markets, the original crypto markets, got their start by facilitating drug trafficking.”

If a rising tide lifts all boats, a rising Bitcoin is lifting all cryptocurrencies too. Other popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Dogecoin are also up.
Musk, the world’s richest man, a prominent supporter of Trump and a known cryptocurrency enthusiast, has been particularly vocal about his support for Dogecoin.
The market share of top cryptocurrencies is as follows:
Dogecoin (DOGE), USD Coin (USDC), Ripple (XRP), TRON (TRX) are other popular cryprocurrencies.
According to CoinMarketCap, a website that provides data on thousands of cryptocurrencies, the global value of cryptocurrency is $2.79 trillion. In 2013, the total crypto market cap was roughly $1bn.
More than 100 countries allow trading of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, with restrictions, while others have outright bans. The US, Canada, European Union, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand are some countries where trading in cryptocurrencies is legal. China, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Bolivia have made it illegal to trade in cryptocurrencies.
Over the last four years, Bitcoin has experienced significant volatility, with prices fluctuating dramatically due to economic events, market sentiment, and regulatory developments. In March 2020, Bitcoin’s price dropped sharply to under $5,000 as global markets reeled from the COVID-19 pandemic. This rapid drop was followed by a huge surge in November 2021, reaching an all-time high of nearly $69,000.
However, crypto markets would experience another downturn due to the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in November 2022. Bitcoin dropped sharply to below $16,000, and Ethereum fell under $1,100.
Trump used to see the cryptocurrencies as a threat to the US dollar.
“I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity,” he posted on twitter, which has since been named X, in 2019.
“We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable.”
That was then, and Trump, with his newly founded cryptocurrency company World Liberty Financial, has now made a 180 degree turn on his confidence in cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
At the Bitcoin 2024 conference in July, Trump took centrestage, making a bold declaration regarding potential future policy. Trump assured the audience that, should he regain the presidency, he would implement measures to prevent the federal government from liquidating its Bitcoin reserves.
“If I am elected, it will be the policy of my administration, United States of America, to keep 100 percent of all the Bitcoin the US government currently holds or acquires into the future,” Trump said.
“If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted and made in the USA,” he added.
Mauvis Ledford, CEO of Sogni AI, a Singapore-based tech startup, says the incoming Trump administration would likely adopt cryptocurrencies to stimulate economic growth.
“It’s plausible that Trump’s administration might explore leveraging blockchain technology to enhance transparency and efficiency in government operations, especially with Elon Musk as an adviser. There could also be initiatives aimed at promoting the adoption of cryptocurrencies to stimulate economic growth and attract tech-driven investments,” Ledford, a former CTO of CoinMarketCap, told Al Jazeera.
However Ledford remains cautious about just how far Trump might go in his support for cryptocurrencies.
“I don’t personally believe anything Trump says, however, and blockchains do allow the creation of rules that everyone must follow, which I don’t think Trump would specifically like in a government he runs,” said Ledford.
Trump has also trained his guns at US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler, who has been known to be highly critical of the cryptocurrency industry.
“On day one, I will fire Gary Gensler,” Trump said at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee.
The SEC’s focus on crypto cases intensified in 2023, as revealed by a January 24 report from Cornerstone Research, a litigation consulting firm. The report detailed 46 enforcement actions last year, resulting in $281m in monetary penalties for settlements.
“We’re trying to enforce the laws at hand. … This is a field with a lot of fraudsters, a lot of grifters, a lot of scams,” Gensler said last month during a discussion at the New York University School of Law.
Ledford too acknowledges the many scams, which he calls “smoke and mirrors”, that have infested parts of the cryptocurrency industry.
“The only ‘tokens’ I truly trust are Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin because it was the first creator of blockchain technology, and a simple form of digital gold – literally all it was meant to be,” said Ledford.
The recent surge could open the door for more investment into cryptocurrencies.
“Narrative drives price. The Biden administration put a choke hold on crypto. Trump, who has publicly supported it, is seen as world, where crypto can thrive with government support. Bullish,” said Roderick Melvin Johnson, active crypto investor since 2021.
Johnson, who is based in Clearwater, Florida, shared with Al Jazeera an important X thread from Miles Deutscher, a prominent crypto analyst, explaining the significance of the Trump presidency and its possible effect on the US economy.
This is the most obvious bullish setup any liquid market has had in YEARS.
That isn't an exaggeration.
I have the data to show you how the stars are aligning for the biggest crypto bull run EVER.

— Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) November 11, 2024

Ledford, the Singapore-based tech CEO, notes that there has been a notable increase in institutional investments in cryptocurrencies which should move the industry into mainstream acceptance.
“Major companies are integrating crypto payments, and advancements in blockchain technology are making transactions more secure and efficient. Additionally, regulatory frameworks are evolving, which could provide more stability and legitimacy to the crypto market,” he explained.
Created in 2009 under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin is a digital currency that exclusively trades online. Using a technology called blockchain, it allows every Bitcoin transaction to be stored on thousands of computers worldwide, known as the “public record”, making it virtually impossible to hack.
Each computer has stored every transaction that has ever been made, which is known as a node. When a new cryptocurrency transaction happens anywhere around the world, every node gets its “public record’ updated. Due to the decentralised nature of blockchain, no one computer controls the data.
Till this day, the creator of Bitcoin is unknown.
In 2010, the first real-world purchase using Bitcoin was two pizzas bought for 10,000 Bitcoins, approximately $41 at the time, by a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz.
In 2021, Bitcoin’s largest transaction was the sale of a luxurious Miami, Florida mansion. The property changed hands for a staggering $22.5m, paid entirely in cryptocurrency.

Ilya Lichtenstein pleaded guilty last year in the case involving the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange being hacked in 2016 and the theft of almost 120,000 bitcoin.
He laundered the stolen cryptocurrency with the help of his wife Heather Morgan, who used the alias Razzlekhan to promote her hip hop music.
At the time of the theft, the bitcoin was worth around $70m (£55.3m), but had risen in value to more than $4.5bn by the time they were arrested. At today's prices they would be worth more than double that.
The $3.6bn worth of assets recovered in the case was the biggest financial seizure in the Department of Justice's history, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said at the time.
“It’s important to send a message that you can’t commit these crimes with impunity, that there are consequences to them,” district judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said.
Lichtenstein, who has been in prison since his arrest in February 2022, expressed remorse for his actions.
He also said that he hopes to apply his skills to fight cybercrime after serving his sentence.
Morgan also pleaded guilty last year to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. She is due to be sentenced on 18 November.
According court documents, Lichtenstein used advanced hacking tools and techniques to hack into Bitfinex.
Following the hack, he enlisted Morgan's help to launder the stolen funds.
They ""employed numerous sophisticated laundering techniques"", the Department of Justice said in a statement.
The methods included using fictitious identities, switching the funds into different cryptocurrencies and buying gold coins.
Lichtenstein, who was born in Russia but grew up in the US, would then meet couriers while on family trips and move the laundered money back home, prosecutors said. 
Morgan's Razzlekhan persona went viral on social media when the case emerged.
Even as the couple attempted to cover up the hack, she published dozens of expletive-filled music videos and rap songs filmed in locations around New York.
In her lyrics she called herself a ""bad-ass money maker"" and ""the crocodile of Wall Street"".
In articles published in Forbes magazine, Morgan also claimed to be a successful technology businesswoman, calling herself an ""economist, serial entrepreneur, software investor and rapper"".
Trump called Xi's meeting with Vietnamese leaders a ploy to figure out how to 'screw' the US. 
Helsinki wants to become a top European start-up hub, but can it challenge London and Stockholm?
Cocoa prices are soaring so new chocolate firms are looking at an alternative ingredient.
Proponents say space-based data centres will be more secure, but sceptics say big hurdles remain.
As anger grows over Trump's tariffs, apps and social media groups are helping people avoid US goods.

 The price of Bitcoin hit a record high on Tuesday afternoon, continuing its dramatic ascent in the two weeks since Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election.

 The cryptocurrency moved as high as $94,000 in afternoon trading, according to the crypto tracker CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin hit a previous record of over $93,000 last week and has teetered around the $90,000 level in recent days. 

 The historically volatile asset has exploded since Trump’s election, jumping nearly 35% from about $70,000 at 9 p.m. ET on the night of the election. Investors are optimistic that the president-elect's support of cryptocurrencies, as well as backing from a crypto-friendly Congress, will lead to policies that benefit the asset class.

 The fresh record comes after a Financial Times report Monday that Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), in which Trump holds a 53% stake, is in talks to buy cryptocurrency trading platform Bakkt (BKKT).

 Investors looking for another way to get involved in Bitcoin will be able to trade options on Blackrock’s (BLK) iShares Bitcoin Trust, a $42 billion ETF that launched in January, beginning Tuesday, according to reporting from Barron’s and others.

 In fact, options trading volume for the ETF reached more than $446 million in its first few hours, according to a report from CryptoSlate.

Bitcoin topped $98,000 for the first time Thursday, extending a streak of almost daily all-time highs since the U.S. presidential election. The cryptocurrency has rocketed more than 40% in just two weeks. 
Now, bitcoin is at the doorstep of $100,000 and investors do not appear to be fazed by gravity or any cautionary tales of the cryptocurrencies history of volatility. 
Cryptocurrencies and related investments like crypto exchange traded funds have rallied because the incoming Trump administration is expected to be more ""crypto-friendly"" than the outgoing Biden administration.
As of 11:02 a.m. ET, bitcoin traded at $96,747 after rising as high as $98,349 according to CoinDesk. 
Yet cryptocurrency markets remain a wild place and what comes next is impossible to know. And while some are bullish, other experts are warning of investment risks.
Here's what you need to know.
Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now but have come under the spotlight in recent years.
In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority — meaning it's typically not backed by any government or banking institution — and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.
Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like Ethereum, Tether and Dogecoin have gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a ""digital alternative"" to traditional money — but it can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.
A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. election.
President-elect Donald Trump, who was once critical of digital currencies, pledged during his campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris to make the U.S. the ""crypto capital of the planet"" and to create a bitcoin ""strategic reserve."" His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.
Crypto industry players welcomed Trump's victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they've long lobbied for. Trump also had promised that, if elected, he would remove the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government's crackdown on the crypto industry and repeatedly called for more oversight.
Digital assets like bitcoin had posted notable gains in the months ahead of the election, mostly due to the early success of a new way to invest in the asset: spot bitcoin ETFs, which were approved by U.S. regulators in January. 
A spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain direct exposure to bitcoin without holding it. Unlike regular bitcoin ETFs, in which bitcoin futures contracts are the underlying asset, bitcoins are the underlying asset of a spot bitcoin ETF.  Each spot bitcoin ETF is managed by a firm that issues shares of its own bitcoin holdings purchased through other holders or through an authorized cryptocurrency exchange. The shares are listed on a traditional stock exchange.
Inflows into spot ETFs, ""have been the dominant driver of Bitcoin returns from some time, and we expect this relationship to continue in the near-term,"" Citi analysts David Glass and Alex Saunders wrote in a research note two weeks ago. They added that spot crypto ETFs saw some of their largest inflows on record in the days following the election.
History shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you've made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.
At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, in a time marked by high demand for technology assets. Bitcoin later crashed during an aggressive series of Federal Reserve rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. The collapse of FTX in late 2022 significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall and bitcoin fell below $17,000.
Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool — and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. Experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors.
Assets like bitcoin are produced through a process called ""mining,"" which consumes a lot of energy. And operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.
Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth's Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin's electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).
Environmental impacts of bitcoin mining boil largely down to the energy source used. Industry analysts have maintained that clean energy has increased in use in recent years, coinciding with rising calls for climate protections.

 Bitcoin (BTCUSD) briefly surged past $99,000 Thursday, creating another price record as investors, big and small, can't seem to get enough of the cryptocurrency.

 The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has more than doubled in value this year, gaining over 130% year-to-date, and is now within striking distance of the $100,000 mark, a level unthinkable a year ago when it traded close to $37,000.

 Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election win earlier this month and the promise of a more crypto-friendly administration has propelled bitcoin prices 46% higher in a little over two weeks.

 Investors also cheered the departure announcement for U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler on Thursday. Gensler faced criticism from the crypto industry for his enforcement approach.

 Bitcoin is getting interest from investors, both retail and institutional.

 Flows into the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) also have been breaking records over the past few weeks. These products hold bitcoin and buy the cryptocurrency as more investors pour money into them, in turn driving bitcoin prices higher.

 And these products not only are getting popular with retail investors. According to data analyzed by Coinbase, more institutional investors—such as hedge funds and investment advisers—bought into spot bitcoin ETFs in the third quarter than in the previous one.

 Meanwhile, bitcoin-related stocks are also on the receiving end of massive action on Wall Street.

 According to Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, what he refers to as the ""Bitcoin Industrial Complex,"" a collection of publicly traded companies and ETFs with direct or indirect exposure to the bitcoin price, posted a record of more than $50 billion in trading volume on Wednesday. Notably, MicroStrategy (MSTR), which pivoted to a strategy of acquiring bitcoin in 2020, recently has had stock trading volumes that rival the likes of Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA).

 MicroStrategy holds more than 331,2000 bitcoin worth more than $32 billion at current prices on its books, and the company's stock has risen more than 500% this year. That's prompted many more publicly traded companies to take a leaf out of MicroStrategy's bitcoin playbook.

 While bitcoin miner Marathon Holdings (MARA) and health-care company Semler Scientific (SMLR) have done that in the past, Cosmos Health (COSM), LQR House (LQR), and Acurx Pharmaceuticals (ACXP) all made announcements about bitcoin purchases this week.

 The $100K price milestone may not be too far away, but many experts say that bitcoin may not sustain a breach of that level for too long.

 Despite the strong interest from institutions, Galaxy Digital Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Mike Novogratz warned that a correction is on the way in an interview with CNBC Thursday morning. “The crypto community is levered to the gills, and so there will be a correction,” Novogratz said.

 He expects bitcoin's price to fall to $80,000 levels, which would represent a 20% drop from the $100,000 mark.

 Bitcoin's original premise as an investment included the fact that it was decoupled from stock markets and instead was viewed as ""digital gold."" Gold is often likened to a safe haven asset in times of turbulence in the stock markets.

 Both bitcoin and gold have established multiple price records in the past few months; however, gold recently has faltered, with some experts even suggesting a rotation out of gold into bitcoin.

 According to data from The Block, bitcoin's 30-day Pearson correlation with gold has gone from 0.82 to -0.66 since Nov. 5, when the U.S. elections occurred.

 This effectively means that bitcoin and gold have shifted from highly correlated to having an inverse correlation in a matter of weeks. That said, bitcoin is still highly correlated with the stock market, maintaining Pearson correlation scores of 0.7 and 0.76 with the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq as of Wednesday.

 The ""bitcoin $100,000"" price milestone has proven elusive. Some analysts are are blaming skittish investors taking profits as companies continue to purchase the crypto asset.

 Bitcoin (BTCUSD), the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, rose to an all-time high over $99,500 on Friday. The $100,000 mark seemed imminent. Now, however, it's closer to $92,000.

 What happened? And what's next?

 Bitcoin's rally picked up steam after Donald Trump's electoral victory, with optimism regarding a more crypto-friendly administration and Congress that could pave the way for regulatory clarity the crypto-industry has been seeking helping to lift bitcoin and other crypto assets.

 Still, that rally has slowed lately. Some analysts say that is likely a result of profit-taking by relatively new investors into the asset, with longer-term investors holding on to their bitcoin.

 Most of the selling ""is coming from 2024 buyers who bought above 56k,"" said Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz in an X post Sunday, citing Galaxy's research. ""Normal profit taking.

 Bitcoin analyst James Check said those who purchased bitcoin around $68,000 six weeks ago are responsible for a large amount of the selling pressure this month.

 Strong selling was also seen in bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Monday, as the category had its third-largest day of outflows on record at $435.3 million, according to Farside Investors.

 This follows the large inflows that seen in these products since Election Day. (BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw $267.8 million of inflows on Monday, despite the net outflows for the category as a whole.)

 Bitcoin ETFs hold bitcoin and they needed to purchase it as more investors poured money into these products. That's why spot bitcoin ETFs were partially responsible for the cryptocurrency's rise this year.

 So far this year, bitcoin prices have more than doubled, gaining roughly 120%. The S&P 500, a broad stock index, has risen about 25%.

 Some analysts called for bitcoin to rise above $100,000, though others figured that might not last. Novogratz in a CNBC interview last week said he expected a price correction, though not one that sends bitcoin below $80,000.

 The recent weakness comes at a time when more companies are purchasing bitcoin. MicroStrategy (MSTR) announced the purchase of another $5.4 billion worth of bitcoin on Monday morning. Companies such as Marathon Digital (MARA), Semler Scientific (SMLR) and Rumble (RUM) have also committed to purchasing bitcoin.

 If that trend continues it could bolster bitcoin prices, according to Coinbase Research.

 ""We think that these corporate inflows represent an increasingly important source of capital inflow into the space as corporate purchase plans that we think may be relatively more price inelastic,"" Coinbase researchers wrote in recent commentary. ""This could contribute to continued market momentum in the near term.""

Ripple's XRP has seen its price skyrocket since Republican Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election—setting up 2025 to be a huge year for bitcoin and crypto.

XRP, briefly becoming the world's third-largest cryptocurrency behind bitcoin and ethereum due to its 400% price rally over the last month, is now approaching its 2017 bull run all-time high after a leak revealed a shock December launch is planned.
Now, as Elon Musk quietly confirms a crypto market game-changer, Wall Street is pushing for Ripple's XRP to win a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), following in the footsteps of bitcoin and ethereum that scored their own spot ETFs this year.

XRP developer Ripple chief executive Brad Garlinghouse has seen the XRP price explode over the last ... More month, leaving the bitcoin price rally in the dust.
ETF giant WisdomTree has joined Bitwise and Canary Capital in filing to create an XRP spot ETF, with Bank of New York Mellon serving as the administrator for the proposed trust.
The fleet of bitcoin spot ETFs that made their U.S. debut in January have surged to become some of the fastest-growing ETFs of all-time, boosting the bitcoin price and sparking widespread speculation about the potential for future crypto spot ETFs to fuel price gains.
Ripple's XRP had languished through the 2021 bitcoin price and crypto market bull run, failing to make major gains as a result of a long-running legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
That war could now be near its end after Gary Gensler, the SEC chair who brought charges against Ripple for XRP sales that it claims amounted to the sale of unregistered securities, said he will quit the agency in January to make way for a U.S. president-elect Donald Trump appointee.
""XRP was in an accumulation phase for nearly three years—around 900 days. The duration of such a phase often determines the strength of the subsequent rally, so it’s no surprise that from November 4, XRP has surged around 404%,"" Arthur Azizov, the chief executive of crypto exchange and payment processor B2BinPay, said in emailed comments, adding the improving regulatory landscape and its ""immense potential"" could push the XRP price beyond its 2017 bull run all-time high in 2025.

The XRP price has rocketed high over the last few weeks, with the cryptocurrency becoming the third ... More largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin and ethereum.
""In the past, XRP's growth was constrained by its ongoing legal battle with the SEC, even as other alt coins rallied,"" Azizov said.
""Right after the announcement of SEC chair Gary Gensler's resignation, XRP has risen by over 36%. His departure has heightened expectations that the ongoing legal battle could soon come to an end in Ripple’s favor. Also, major companies are reportedly planning XRP ETFs, awaiting the conclusion of the lawsuit, which could also pave the way for an IPO"" for Ripple.
The crypto community is betting Trump will install a crypto-friendly SEC chair due to his close links to crypto via his non-fungible token (NFT) collections and his new cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) platform World Liberty Financial.

 Stocks rose to new highs Wednesday, led by big gains for shares of technology companies, while bitcoin surpassed $100,000 for the first time, as a month-long post-election rally shows no signs of fading.

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 gained 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.3%, as each of the major indexes hit record intraday and closing highs today.

 Stocks are off to a strong start this month, after posting their biggest monthly gains of the year in November, as investor optimism runs high that the incoming Trump administration will implement pro-growth policies that translate into strong corporate earnings and continued stock market gains.

 Bitcoin has also surged amid market expectations that the White House and a crypto-friendly Congress will approve measures that support the asset class. Bitcoin was trading at around $103,300 at around 11:15 p.m. ET, up from a low earlier Wednesday of around $95,000.

 The surge followed news Wednesday afternoon that President-elect Trump named Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins would succeed Gary Gensler, a critic of the crypto industry who last month said he would step down in January. 

 Among the big movers on the stock market Wednesday, Salesforce (CRM) shares jumped 11% to lead Dow and S&P 500 gainers, after the cloud software company reported better-than-expected quarterly results and issued a rosy full-year outlook, boosted by booming demand for AI. Shares of Marvell Technology (MRVL) soared 23%, topping the list of Nasdaq advancers, after the chipmaker released a strong earnings report.

 Large-cap technology stocks were higher across the board, led by a 3.5% gain for AI investor favorite Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL) Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla (TSLA) and Broadcom (AVGO) also gained ground.

 Investors were keeping a close eye on remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Powell, who spoke at an event in New York this afternoon, ahead of the critical November jobs report that is slated to be released Friday morning.

 The Fed chief said that the U.S. economy is in good shape—with unemployment remaining low and progress being made on inflation—and that the Fed can be cautious as it considers further cuts to interest rates. The Fed's final rate-policy meeting of the year is set for two weeks from today, and investors expect the central bank to announce a quarter-point cut to the benchmark fed funds rate.

 The yield on 10-year Treasurys, which is correlated with expectations about where rates are headed, fell to 4.19%, down from Tuesday's closing level of 4.22%.

 Gold futures rose slightly on Wednesday to $2,675 an ounce, while crude oil futures were down about 1.5%.

Bitcoin Levels to Watch as Cryptocurrency Soars Above $100K
 Bitcoin (BTCUSD) soared above $100,000 for the first time late Wednesday as investors bet that the incoming Trump administration and Congress will support policies that benefit the cryptocurrency market. 

 Wednesday's rally followed news that President-elect Donald Trump named crypto enthusiast Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Atkins would replace crypto critic Garry Gensler, who said he would step down in January.

 Bitcoin was recently trading at $103,300, up from around $95,000 before news of the SEC nomination. Since the election, Bitcoin has surged more than 45% as investors bid up the digital asset on expectations of more crypto-friendly policies.

 With the move, Bitcoin has broken out above a newly formed pennant, a chart pattern that signals a continuation of the cryptocurrency’s current move higher.

 A measure moved, which calculates the move higher that preceded the pennant and adds that amount to the pattern’s top trendline, projects a bullish target of $129,930.

 Investors should monitor key support levels on Bitcoin's chart around $90,500, $80,500 and $70,000.

Chipotle Stock Climbs as Menu Prices Increase
 Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is raising prices across the U.S., the company said Wednesday. “For the first time in over a year, we have taken a modest price increase of approximately 2% nationally to offset inflation,” Chipotle Chief Corporate Affairs Officer Laurie Schalow said in an email to Investopedia. 

 New Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Scott Boatwright, elevated to the top job last month, on the company’s most-recent earnings conference call in October said there was “nothing planned today, but that's not to say we wouldn't look at a pricing action at some point in the future.” A Wall Street Journal article last week alluded to the possibility of higher prices at Chipotle.

Spencer Platt / Getty Images
 Shares of Chipotle rose 4.9% to $63.90 Wednesday, leaving them 40% higher this year so far. 

 “The menu price increase is earlier than we … expected” and “a positive for the stock, in our view,” Truist Securities analysts wrote Wednesday. “We believe CMG is taking the menu price from a point of strength.” The analysts edged their price target on the shares up $2 to $74, a bit above Wall Street’s average of $68 per Visible Alpha data.

 The effects of the menu price increases would likely be seen in the company’s fourth-quarter financial results, set for release in early February.

Chewy Stock Slides After Weak Earnings 
 Chewy (CHWY) shares fell Wednesday after the online pet supplies retailer missed profit forecasts as the number of active customers fell and costs rose.

 The company reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.20, while the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha was $0.23. Revenue rose 4.8% year-over-year to $2.88 billion, slightly more than expected.

 Chewy said active customers declined 0.5% to 20.16 million and operating expenses rose 3.3% to $818.2 million.

 Chewy anticipates current-quarter sales of $3.18 billion to $3.20 billion. It revised its full-year sales outlook to $11.79 billion to $11.81 billion from the previous $11.60 billion to $11.80 billion.

TradingView
 Chewy shares were down 4% in recent trading. Despite today's decline, they're up about 35% higher this year.

 The stock has had an interesting run in 2024 after meme stock hero Keith Gill, better known as ""Roaring Kitty,"" took a large stake in the company over the summer, only to dump it a few months later.

Okta Stock Rises on Strong Earnings, Outlook
 Shares of Okta (OKTA) rose Wednesday, a day after the business security software provider posted better-than-expected results and current-quarter guidance as subscription revenue rose.

 The company reported third-quarter fiscal 2025 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.67, with revenue rising 14% year-over-year to $665 million. Both exceeded consensus estimates of analysts polled by Visible Alpha. Subscription revenue gained 14% to $651 million.

 Okta anticipates fourth-quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $0.73 to $0.74, and revenue of $667 million to $669 million, ahead of forecasts.

 Okta shares were up 5% in mid-afternoon trading, narrowing their year-to-date losses to about 5%.

Trump Names Paul Atkins to Lead SEC
 President-elect Donald Trump named Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), his latest move to fill key financial roles in the next administration. 

 Atkins, CEO of Washington, D.C.-based consulting firm Patomak Global Partners, was an SEC Commissioner under former President George W. Bush and has worked lately on issues related to digital assets—a subject expected to be a focus of the incoming Trump administration.

David Paul Morris / Bloomberg / Getty Images
 ""Paul is a proven leader for common sense regulations,"" Trump wrote Wednesday on the Truth Social platform.

  ""He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before.""
The SEC is broadly responsible for oversight of financial markets and investor protection. Atkins, who would require Senate confirmation, would succeed Gary Gensler, who last month said he would step down in January. 

 Trump recently named billionaire hedge-fund manager Scott Bessent his pick for Treasury Secretary and Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick to lead the Commerce Department. Media reports have also suggested that Trump is considering possible replacements for Fed Chair Jerome Powell. 

 Trump likely would have the opportunity to replace several SEC commissioners whose terms are set to expire during his administration.

Wall Street Bullish on Salesforce Amid AI Demand
 Salesforce (CRM) shares jumped to a record high Wednesday after the company raised its full-year outlook, and analysts are offering increasingly bullish price targets. 

 Stifel maintained its “outperform” rating and raised its price target to $425 from $390.

 The firm called Salesforce “the best way to play AI” due to its multi-cloud customer base and its ability to “drive market penetration” with its Customer 360 customer relationship management platform.

 Then there’s Agentforce, Salesforce’s suite of autonomous AI agents made generally available on October 25. Agentforce was included in 200 deals in the quarter, “underscoring healthy early interest,” analysts at Bank of America said.

  The bank upped its price target to $440 from $390.

 Salesforce has “a combined market share of only 15% and a formidable competitive moat,” BofA added. “[W]e believe a long runway exists for Salesforce to continue growing.”

 Salesforce shares were up 8% at around $358 in recent trading.

Marvell Levels to Watch as Stock Soars After Strong Earnings
 Marvell Technology (MRVL) jumped Wednesday morning after the chipmaker posted strong quarterly results and issued a rosy outlook amid robust demand for its custom AI chips.

 The stock broke out from an ascending triangle on above-average volume early this week, a bullish chart pattern that indicates a continuation of the uptrend.

 A bars pattern, which takes the price bars from the stock’s trending move between October and November and repositions them from the ascending triangle’s lower trendline, forecasts a price target of around $120.

 Investors should monitor important support levels on Marvell's chart around $95, $84 and $76.

 The stock was up 22% at around $117 in recent trading and is up about 90% since the start of 2024.

Foot Locker Stock Slides on Surprise Loss, Slashed Guidance
 Foot Locker (FL) shares tumbled Wednesday after the company posted an unexpected third-quarter loss and cut its full-year outlook. 

 The athletic sneaker retailer reported a loss of $33 million or 34 cents per share, compared to a profit of $28 million or 30 cents per share a year earlier. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha had called for profit to increase year-over-year to $37 million. Revenue was $1.96 billion, down 1.4% year-over-year and above the Street’s expectations. 

 CEO Mary Dillon said the loss occurred as ""[c]onsumer spending trends softened following the peak back-to-school period"" and ""the promotional environment was more elevated than anticipated."" Selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A), which includes marketing spending, rose 8% year-over-year to $482 million. 

 Foot Locker also got more conservative with its full-year forecast. It now expects sales to fall between 1.5% and 1% from $8.15 billion in 2023, compared to a prior range of a 1% loss to 1% growth. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to land between $1.20 and $1.30, down from $1.50 to $1.70. Analysts had called for $1.55.

TradingView
 Shares of Foot Locker were down 12% in recent trading and have lost nearly a third of their value since the beginning of the year.

Dollar Tree Stock Rises as Earnings Top Estimates
 Dollar Tree (DLTR) shares rose Wednesday morning after the discount retailer reported better-than-expected third-quarter results.

 The company recorded $7.57 billion in revenue and $233.3 million in net income, up from $7.31 billion and $212.0 million a year ago.

 The company the projects full-year revenue of between $30.7 billion and $30.9 billion, with the bottom end lifted from $30.6 billion previously. Full-year adjusted earnings per share (EPS) is seen between $5.31 and $5.51, compared with the previous range of $5.20 to $5.60.

 Dollar Tree said that its ""strategic review"" of options for the Family Dollar brand announced in June ""remains on track,"" with no set timeline to be completed. Roughly a decade after Dollar Tree acquired the brand, a sale or spinoff remains a possibility.

 Of the nearly 1,000 ""underperforming"" Family Dollar locations that the company said it planned to shut down earlier this year, Dollar Tree has closed about 670 through Q3, and expects to close another 25 in the fourth quarter.

TradingView
 Dollar Tree shares jumped 5% at the open Wednesday and were up about 1.5% recently. The stock has lost half its value since the start of the year.

Palantir Levels to Watch as Stock Hits Record High
 Palantir (PLTR) shares are likely to remain in focus today after jumping to a new high yesterday following news that the analytics software provider's entire product suite has received approval for use in processing sensitive federal workloads.

 Since breaking out from a pennant last week, Palantir shares have continued to trend higher, with gains accelerating following Tuesday's news.

 While the relative strength index confirms bullish price momentum above the 70 threshold, the indicator also flashes overbought conditions that could lead to short-term profit-taking.

 The measuring principle, which calculates the distance of the impulsive trend that preceded the pennant and adds that amount to the pattern’s upper trendline, forecasts an upside price target in the stock of $89.

 Investors should watch important support levels on Palantir's chart around $58.50, $45, and $38.

 Palantir shares were up 1% at $71.70 about an hour before Wednesday's opening bell. The stock gained nearly 7% on Tuesday.

Bitcoin hit $100,000 for the first time on Wednesday, a remarkable milestone for a cryptocurrency created over 15 years ago from what was essentially computer coding created under mysterious circumstances.
The surge has been nothing short of spectacular. The value of bitcoin has more than doubled this year, turbocharged by the election of Donald Trump. 
It's easy to see why. Trump has promised to make the U.S. ""the crypto capital of the planet"" by bringing in friendly regulators and ending the tough enforcement actions taken against the sector under President Joe Biden. 
In fact, bitcoin hit the $100,000 milestone after Trump picked crypto supporter Paul Atkins as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier in the day, raising hope for a more friendly Wall Street cop for the industry.
Trump has also proposed a crypto ""strategic reserve,"" potentially turning the country into a direct investor of cryptocurrencies. His family even has financial interests in a crypto venture.
Crypto investors may be cheering Trump on — but critics are raising alarms.
Cryptocurrencies have long had a history of fraud and scams, as the 2022 collapse of crypto exchange FTX made clear. And they have been notoriously volatile. Some critics believe they could even pose a risk to the country's financial system.
Here are three things to know about bitcoin's spectacular ride.
For bitcoin, Trump's return to the White House promises to be a game changer.  Prices have surged since Election Day, with the rally gaining steam before Trump was even elected as investors anticipated his victory.
It's been a remarkably rally for a cryptocurrency created by a mysterious character — or characters — by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, whose real identity has not been unveiled so far.
Trump was once a skeptic of cryptocurrencies, calling them a ""scam"" and telling Fox Business they were ""potentially a disaster waiting to happen.""
Things have changed.
Trump avidly courted votes from the crypto industry by promising to usher in a crypto-friendly administration. On Wednesday, he appointed Atkins to replace current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who had antagonized the crypto industry with aggressive enforcement actions, especially against key players. Gensler had said last month he would resign on Jan. 20, the day Trump is due to be inaugurated.
Trump is also expected to appoint similarly-minded regulators at other agencies important to the sector, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
In addition to supporting Trump, the crypto sector spent millions to elect friendly people to Congress. Those efforts included helping Republican Bernie Moreno, a businessman who has expressed support for cryptocurrencies, defeat Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio. Brown is the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and is skeptical of cryptocurrencies.
Republicans will also control Congress next year, fueling hopes in the crypto sector for far more favorable regulations.

                Executives of BlackRock ring the opening bell as investment funds tied to bitcoin are launched on the Nasdaq Exchange in New York City on Jan. 11, 2024 in New York City. The launch of these investment funds have helped bitcoin go a little more mainstream.

The swiftness of the bitcoin rally over the past couple of weeks has investors hoping for further gains. But they're not just optimistic because of Trump and the Republican Congress.
Bitcoin is becoming more mainstream, especially since earlier this year when Gensler reluctantly approved the launch of investment funds tied to bitcoin (called exchange-traded funds) that can be held by average investors. 
These funds have proven popular, with overall assets rising above $100 billion. That's increasing demand for bitcoin. 
However, cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile. The industry has also seen spectacular implosions.  FTX, once the world's biggest crypto exchange, collapsed in 2022 and its founder and CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, was convicted of fraud for stealing billions in customer money. Bankman-Fried was later sentenced to 25 years in prison.
The volatile and checkered history of cryptocurrencies has many critics alarmed.
Dennis Kelleher, president and CEO of the advocacy group Better Markets, worries that average investors may be lured by the promises of riches and end up being the victims of scams.
""Crypto is the priority of the crypto billionaires who are getting rich through speculators and gamblers with crypto. And frankly, there's a bunch of them getting rich due to criminal activities from money laundering to financing terrorists and rogue states, and tax evasion,"" Kelleher said in a recent interview with NPR.
""But that money's all coming from the pockets of people who are being duped into thinking that this particular new financial product has some value, or worth, when it really is nothing but a vehicle for speculation,"" he added.
If looser regulations help make cryptocurrencies more mainstream, they could become further integrated into the country's financial system, raising the prospect of increased volatility and potentially even financial crises, Kelleher warns.
""The clock will start ticking on a coming catastrophic financial crash that, in my view, will be much worse than 2008,"" Kelleher said, referring to that year's global financial crisis. ""It's only a matter of time.""

The price of one bitcoin hit $100,000 for the first time Wednesday as demand for the digital currency continued to surge in the wake of an election that saw victories for crypto-friendly candidates led by President-elect Donald Trump. 
Since Nov. 5, the price of bitcoin has surged more than 45%. Year to date, prices have more than doubled. 
The six-figure mark is the latest lucrative milestone for a digital currency that emerged 15 years ago from a brief white paper written by a still-unknown author. The ideas that author, known as Satoshi Nakamoto, spelled out have since spawned an entire technological landscape dedicated to peer-to-peer transactions that now includes hundreds of other digital tokens as well as NFTs and trading platforms. 
But cryptocurrencies have remained controversial: Many of them, including bitcoin itself, have helped fuel a rise in cybercrimes and scams that the FBI says were responsible for billions of dollars in consumer losses last year. 
That's prompted current federal regulators to take a skeptical view of many cryptocurrency efforts. 
In the wake of the election, bitcoin advocates are hoping a new pro-crypto view will take hold in Washington that will put an end to strict regulation of and enforcement against digital tokens, while opening up bitcoin investing to traditional financial institutions and making it more profitable to mine bitcoin by increasing energy production. 
Trump, once a crypto-skeptic, has expressed interest in creating a U.S. bitcoin ""strategic reserve"" modeled on those for gold and oil. During his third presidential run, he appeared at this year's Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, Tennessee, to praise the crypto community for its innovation while vowing to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world if elected.
Bitcoin's price movements remain notoriously volatile, and that is unlikely to change no matter who is in office, experts say.
Yet the upward price-growth over time is undeniable. More recently, a large share of demand fueling that growth has been funneled into exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, that track the price of bitcoin and are operated by major financial institutions, with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF being the largest.
In an interview, Jay Jacobs, BlackRock's U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs, said that since launching in January, the IBIT ETF has grown to a value of more than $45 billion — and that just in the past month, it's seen its value increase by $4.1 billion. 
In addition to the electoral success of candidates friendlier to crypto, Jacobs said greater numbers of investors across the wealth spectrum — and throughout the world — are coming to view bitcoin as a hedge against geopolitical risks, especially currency devaluations sparked by inflation. 
With ETFs serving as an easy-to-use way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin's price movements, it's only a matter of time before mainstream interest in the cryptocurrency reaches a tipping point, Jacobs said.
""There's growing interest across institutional or wealth-management space to learn, but it’s always going to be a journey of education, and it takes time for that process for happen,"" he said.

The value of the world's biggest cryptocurrency has been boosted by hopes US President-elect Donald Trump will adopt crypto-friendly policies. 
The milestone was reached hours after Trump said he would nominate former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Paul Atkins to run the Wall Street regulator.
Mr Atkins is seen as being far more pro-cryptocurrency than the current head of the SEC, Gary Gensler.
The $100,000 milestone prompted celebrations from cryptocurrency fans around the world.
Bitcoin's wildly fluctuating value has always attracted interest, with its backers reacting with delight when it has passed previous price thresholds - and defiance during its slumps.
But this particular landmark has been especially keenly anticipated. For weeks charts, memes and predictions have swirled around social media about when the price would hit the figure thought to be one of the holy grails of the crypto world.
Millions of viewers even tuned in to online watch parties as the price hovered close to $100k.
The value of a single bitcoin is one of the barometers of optimism in the cryptocurrency industry which is now estimated to be worth $3.3tn, according to analysis firm Coin Market Cap.
Trump's election victory last month was the catalyst for the latest surge. 
The president-elect has vowed to make the US ""the crypto capital of the planet"" - a remarkable turnaround given as recently as 2021 he was calling Bitcoin a ""scam.""
Also remarkable is just how Bitcoin's price has rocketed. A valuation of $100k represents a 40% increase on election day in the U.S. and more than double the price it started the year at.
But there's lots more to Bitcoin than the dizzying changes in its value.
From its enigmatic inventor to the bringing down of the so-called Crypto King, it's a story with many twists and turns, which has seen the making - and losing - of huge fortunes.
So here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history.
Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto.
They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email.
Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers.
But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out.
In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be a false lead caused by some mistranslated information.
Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi.
Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.
Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza.
On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas.
A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day.
A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.
Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin.
The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!
In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.
Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.
Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.
While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped.
He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.
As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years. 
The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.
It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value. 
A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.
In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.
These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.
Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves.
At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment.
But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts.
Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth.
Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact.
Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (£78m) - and then  accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details.
That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him
The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline.
Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him.
He told the BBC: ""It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.""
No-one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.
FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.
Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.
Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: ""I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.""
After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.
Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.
In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.
Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.
It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined.
Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold.

The MP's office says ""steps were taken quickly to secure the account and remove misleading posts"".
Figures from Action Fraud shows cryptocurrency fraud is on the rise, a police force says.
Aleksej Besciokov is wanted by the US for allegedly laundering money and violating sanctions. 
Hackers from the infamous Lazarus Group are in a cat-and-mouse game to launder their stolen funds from the ByBit heist.
The reserve will hold cryptocurrency forfeited to the government in criminal or civil proceedings, said the White House.

Experts weigh in.",2024-12-05,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/late-buy-bitcoin-after-hit-100000-experts-weigh/story?id=116479991,"The price of bitcoin has soared nearly 50% since Election Day.
The price of bitcoin topped $100,000 for the first time ever late Wednesday, and soared to a fresh high in early trading on Thursday.
The new gains extended a rally set off by the election of former President Donald Trump, who is viewed as friendly toward cryptocurrency.
In a post on Truth Social on Thursday, Trump took credit for the gains: “CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU'RE WELCOME!!!.”
Since Election Day, the price of bitcoin has climbed nearly 50%. That performance far outpaces the S&P 500, which has risen about 5% over the same period.
But the breakneck pace of bitcoin’s growth poses a quandary for investors: Is it too late to buy into the rally, or will the good times continue to roll?
Investment analysts who spoke with ABC News gave reason to be optimistic about further gains, citing expectations of a friendly regulatory environment under Trump and continued interest rate cuts at the Federal Reserve.
The surge of momentum alone may pull investors from the sidelines, propelling the price of bitcoin higher, they added.
Analysts, however, warned that bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset, making it all but impossible to predict where its price will go next.
“Bitcoin clearly has some things going in its favor,” said Mark Hamrick, Washington bureau chief and senior economic analyst for Bankrate.com.
“The problem with bitcoin is that it’s unclear what drives the underlying fundamentals of the asset,” Hamrick added. “If somebody were to ask me where bitcoin is going in the next week, month or year, I have no idea.”
At least for now, bitcoin is on a tear. The latest surge coincided with a piece of good news for the crypto industry: Trump’s nomination on Wednesday of Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Atkins, the CEO of consulting firm Patomak Partners, serves as co-chair of the Token Alliance, a cryptocurrency advocacy organization.
Once a crypto critic, Trump has vowed to bolster the cryptocurrency sector and ease regulations enforced by the Biden administration. Trump has also promised to establish the federal government's first National Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.
The positive developments for crypto extend well beyond Trump. In recent months, the Fed has cut interest rates and forecasted additional rate cuts to come. In theory, lower rates could ease consumer borrowing costs and drive more investment in bitcoin.
Strong performance this year has also been driven by U.S. approval in January of bitcoin ETFs, or exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to buy into an asset that tracks the price movement of bitcoin, while avoiding the inconvenience and risk of purchasing the crypto coin itself.
Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at eToro, said those favorable conditions for bitcoin are likely to persist.
“Those same catalysts have the longer-term picture still looking bright for bitcoin,” Kenwell told ABC News in a statement.
Still, experts offered up warnings about the volatility of bitcoin. Even amid its meteoric rise this year, bitcoin experienced a temporary downswing that slashed one-third of its value, Kenwell noted.
As recently as 2021, bitcoin suffered a downturn that cut its value in half. The same thing happened a year earlier, when the initial outset of the pandemic triggered a panic among investors.
Bitcoin has proven sensitive to negative developments for crypto and the wider market in part because it is difficult to peg the value of the asset, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told ABC News.
Stock investors typically assess the value of a company’s shares by evaluating its service or product. Since bitcoin isn’t currently used as anything besides a store of value, the lack of a clear utility leaves little basis for assessing bitcoin’s value, which contributes to its volatile price movements, Sosnick added.
“Bitcoin isn’t really used in the real world,” Sosnick said, noting the asset could still move higher nevertheless.
“Right now, the public is very enamored with bitcoin,” Sosnick said. “It’s foolish to say that any number – whether it’s $75,000 or $100,000 or anything – is the end of the rise.”

 Bitcoin (BTCUSD) traded above $100,000 for the first time ever late Wednesday, then kept rising.

 The largest cryptocurrency by market cap recently traded above $103,000, according to CoinDesk. The most recent price surge came after President-elect Donald Trump nominated pro-crypto Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 Bitcoin had come close to breaching $100,000 in November thanks to a post-election rally, later falling as low as $91,000 amid profit taking. The latest moves have the estimated total market cap of crypto above $3.7 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.

 The late-year rally in bitcoin prices has been driven largely by the expectation of more clarity around cryptocurrency regulation and a more crypto-friendly administration since Trump's electoral victory, with investors pouring money into bitcoin alongside crypto-related stocks and exchange-traded funds.

 ""One of the big changes taking place in the US post-election is the emergence of a new (""counter"") elite that is much more comfortable with innovations and disruption, is pro-liberalization and de-regulation, and is generally less risk-averse,"" wrote Mohamed El-Arian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, early Thursday on X. ""It is a change that... significantly enhances prospects for wider institutional and retail adoption of crypto assets and, therefore, their role in the payments eco-system and as part of investment portfolios.""

 Investors have cheered news about the incoming administration setting up a cryptocurrency advisory council and, possibly, also a bitcoin strategic reserve. 

 The nomination of Atkins for SEC chair was seen as more good news for the crypto industry after the current leader of the agency, Gary Gensler, announced his departure from the role. Gensler was often criticized by crypto backers for the SEC's enforcement-heavy approach under his leadership.

 Bitcoin-related stocks have also see gains lately. MicroStrategy (MSTR), which owns over 402,100 bitcoin—worth over $40 billion at current prices—is up more than 540% year-to-date.

 It had already been a busy year for bitcoin, with the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs and a ""halving"" that slowed down the pace at which new bitcoin are brought into supply. A supply-demand imbalance has helped drive bitcoin prices higher.

 Still, some experts warn against use of excessive leverage and over-exuberance on the part of investors. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Investment Partners, has said he expects bitcoin prices to move back toward $80,000.

 “The crypto community is levered to the gills, and so there will be a correction,"" he said recently on CNBC.

 Bitcoin bulls remained largely undeterred during recent wobbles in bitcoin's price.

 In the near term, its price could be propped up by a spate of corporate purchases as bitcoin gains footing as a mainstream investment over the longer term, with sudden price volatility offering buying opportunities.

 ""One reason bitcoin pullbacks have been so violent in the past is that, every time BTC started to retreat, people would start to worry that it was going to $0. That's now off the table, and there is a growing sea of investors looking for an entry point instead,"" said Bitwise Investment CIO Matt Hougan in a late-November note.

The world's largest cryptocurrency rose to around $103,400 shortly after 04:00 GMT on Thursday, before falling slightly.
Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, described it as a ""magic moment"" for the cryptocurrency and said it had a ""clear link"" to Donald Trump's election victory.
Trump took to social media to celebrate the milestone, posting ""congratulations Bitcoiners"" and ""you're welcome!""
The president-elect had previously pledged to make the US the ""crypto capital"" and ""Bitcoin superpower"" of the world, helping to push Bitcoin's price higher once he was elected president.
It broke through the $100k barrier after Trump said he would nominate former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Paul Atkins to run the Wall Street regulator.
Mr Atkins is seen as being far more pro-cryptocurrency than the current head, Gary Gensler.
""Clearly there is anticipation that the new administration is going to be somewhat more favourable to crypto than the old administration was,""  said Andrew O'Neill, digital assets expert at S&P Global. 
""So for the price of Bitcoin, I think that that's what's driven the trend so far [and it will] likely continue into the new year,"" he added.
However, Bitcoin has a history of sharp falls as well as rapid rises - and some analysts have cautioned that is unlikely to change.
“A lot of people have got rich from the cryptocurrency soaring in value this year, but this high-risk asset isn’t suitable for everyone,"" said Mr Coatsworth.
""It’s volatile, unpredictable and is driven by speculation, none of which makes for a sleep-at-night investment.""
During the US presidential election campaign, Trump sought to appeal to cryptocurrency investors with a promise to sack Gary Gensler - chair of the US financial regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) - on ""day one"" of his presidency.
Mr Gensler's approach to the cryptocurrency sector has been decidedly less friendly than Trump's.
He told the BBC in September it was an industry “rife with fraud and hucksters and grifters”.
Under his leadership, the SEC brought a record 46 crypto-related enforcement actions against firms in 2023.
Mr Gensler said in November he would step down on 20 January - the day of Trump's inauguration.
The choice of Paul Atkins to replace him at the helm of the SEC has been welcomed by crypto advocates.
Mike Novogratz, founder and chief executive of US crypto firm Galaxy Digital said he hoped the ""clearer regulatory path"" would now accelerate the digital currency ecosystem's entry into ""the financial mainstream.""
Bitcoin has seen fewer drastic falls in value during 2024 than in previous years.
In 2022 its price fell sharply below $16,000 after crypto exchange FTX collapsed into bankruptcy.
A number of key events besides Trump's victory in the election have helped boost investor confidence that its value will keep going up.
The SEC approved several spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) allowing giant investment firms like Blackrock, Fidelity and Grayscale to sell products based on the price of Bitcoin. 
Some of these products have seen billions of dollars in cash inflows.
But its potential to suddenly plummet in value serves as a reminder that it is not like orthodox currencies - and investors have no protection or recourse if they lose money on Bitcoin investments.
Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, told BBC News that fear of missing out (FOMO) among younger people will see Bitcoin's price continue to rise.
But she added that while this could spark a rise in other cryptocurrencies, many of the younger investors investing in meme coins are losing money.
Kathleen Breitman, co-founder of another cryptocurrency - Tezos - also had a word of caution for those tempted to invest in Bitcoin.
""These are markets that tend to move on momentum so you need to be extraordinarily cautious with it,"" she told the BBC.
The MP's office says ""steps were taken quickly to secure the account and remove misleading posts"".
Figures from Action Fraud shows cryptocurrency fraud is on the rise, a police force says.
Aleksej Besciokov is wanted by the US for allegedly laundering money and violating sanctions. 
Hackers from the infamous Lazarus Group are in a cat-and-mouse game to launder their stolen funds from the ByBit heist.
The reserve will hold cryptocurrency forfeited to the government in criminal or civil proceedings, said the White House.

Geoff Bennett:
Meantime, the world's largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, hit a record high, rising above the $100,000 mark for the first time yesterday. And it came just hours after president-elect Donald Trump announced cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins as his pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr. Trump, who saw crypto as a scam just a few years back, is now a full supporter, and he took credit for the surge on his TRUTH Social platform, saying: ""Congratulations, Bitcoiners. You're welcome.""
Atkins was an SEC commissioner under former President George W. Bush, and he favors lighter regulation of financial firms.
For more on crypto's soaring values and the Trump-Atkins connection to all of this, I spoke earlier today with David Yaffe-Bellany. He's a technology reporter who covers the crypto industry for The New York Times.
Thanks for being with us.
David Yaffe-Bellany, The New York Times:
Thanks for having me.
Geoff Bennett:
So, first, for the unfamiliar, explain what it means that Bitcoin surpassed the $100,000 mark. Why is that significant?
David Yaffe-Bellany:
It's really an important symbolic threshold for Bitcoin. This is an investment product that started at zero in value, and over the last 15, 20 years has risen to become one of the most successful assets in the entire financial system.
And so it's really the culmination of an extraordinary roller coaster ride that's been going on for a while. And it's a sign that this is part of the financial system now. It's not a passing fad. It's something that is here to stay and that really holds tremendous real-world value.
Geoff Bennett:
Since Donald Trump's win a month ago, the price has surged by some 45 percent. How much of this run-up has to do with him and his team?
David Yaffe-Bellany:
It has a ton to do with Donald Trump. I mean, it's not entirely a Trump phenomenon. This run-up started before the election, after financial firms began offering investment products tied to Bitcoin that sort of made crypto a little bit more accessible to the public.
But Trump has really given it the most significant boost of the year. On the campaign trail, he said he was a Bitcoin believer. He said he would start a national Bitcoin stockpile, that the government would kind of buy Bitcoin. And that just created a tremendous amount of investor enthusiasm in the industry. And it's what has propelled us to the last couple of days with Bitcoin surging past 100K.
Geoff Bennett:
And yet it wasn't that long ago that we were covering the collapse of FTX and the industry seemed to be in a slump. What happened? What changed so quickly?
David Yaffe-Bellany:
Yes, absolutely.
I mean, it's worth remembering that in the relatively short history of crypto, there have already been several boom-and-bust cycles. And so this kind of fits that pattern. And we could well head for another bust at some point. So I don't think people should assume that Bitcoin will stay at this high level forever, necessarily.
But what's changed is that traditional financial firms BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, have started offering exchange traded funds tied to Bitcoin. They have basically allowed traditional investors who might not want to experiment with cryptocurrency, they have given them kind of a way to gain exposure to the Bitcoin market.
And that's driven a whole lot of new investment into the crypto world. And that kind of tied to Donald Trump's enthusiasm for crypto, his promise to end some of the regulatory crackdowns on the industry has kind of driven the price way up.
Geoff Bennett:
Let's talk more about Paul Atkins and his connection to crypto and how his leadership of the SEC might be different than the current chair, Gary Gensler.
David Yaffe-Bellany:
Gary Gensler has been the number one villain of the crypto industry for the last few years. It's really kind of hard to overstate the amount of animosity that the industry feels toward him. And that's because he's sued crypto companies, argued that they're violating securities rules, and essentially put the industry in a position where it could be driven offshore.
The expectation is that Paul Atkins will significantly deviate from that approach. He is somebody who has worked closely with the industry and the private sector, who served on the advisory board of a crypto industry alliance.
And so crypto companies and founders are very enthusiastic right now. They're expecting him to kind of abandon the Gensler approach and really take a much kind of lighter touch approach to the crypto industry.
Geoff Bennett:
And what more do we know about Donald Trump's change of heart on crypto over the last year or two?
David Yaffe-Bellany:
Yes, I mean, this is something that I think people sometimes look past, but when he was president during his first term, Trump said things like Bitcoin's a scam, it's designed to undermine the U.S. dollar.
And he really pivoted on the campaign trail this year. The obvious explanation, I think, is that the crypto industry has been spending a huge amount of money on campaign contributions and has really become kind of a financial heavyweight in politics. And so there was sort of a kind of opportunistic element to Trump's pivot on the issue.
But he's also said that he genuinely changed his mind about crypto, that his sons, including Barron, are super enthusiastic about the technology and that they kind of talked him into kind of being more enthusiastic about it.
Geoff Bennett:
David Yaffe-Bellany of The New York Times, thanks for your insights this evening. We appreciate it.
David Yaffe-Bellany:
Thanks for having me.

The milestone was reached amid Trump's announcement that he would be nominating Paul Atkins as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who is expected to bring market deregulation. The president-elect had promised on the campaign trail to replace outgoing chairman Gary Gensler, an appointee of President Joe Biden whose enforcement efforts led to clashes with Wall Street.
Trump had also vowed at a July bitcoin conference in Nashville to create a crypto-friendly administration and overhaul U.S. policy, including plans for a new crypto advisory council.
The president-elect celebrated − and took credit for − the milestone in a post on his Truth Social platform Thursday morning: ""CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!!""
Excitement about a crypto-friendly administration has for months been pushing Bitcoin, the world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, to its long-awaited $100,000 milestone.
Cryptocurrency, which is 16 years old, is a digital currency and does not rely on banks to verify transactions.
Bitcoin more than doubled in value this year and has soared over 45% since the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election, which has also seen a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers being elected to Congress. Since Trump's sweeping victory, traders have bet that Trump's stated commitment to support cryptocurrencies would lead to a less restrictive regulatory environment, lifting the sector overall, Reuters reported.
Trump courted support and campaign donations from the sector with promises to be a ""crypto president"" and end Biden's crackdown on crypto companies that regulators accused of flouting securities and anti-money laundering laws.
The industry is pushing for executive orders guaranteeing crypto companies' access to banking services, an end to enforcement actions and other changes.
The Bitcoin benchmark comes in the same week that Trump announced his nomination of Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Atkins, 66, is the CEO and founder of Patomak Global Partners, a financial consulting firm with clients that include cryptocurrency firms and exchanges.
Atkins is well-known as a pro-business former federal regulator who is friendly toward the budding cryptocurrency industry. He's also familiar among Republican business circles and the co-chairman of the Digital Chamber's Token Alliance, which has advocated for Bitcoin and other digital currencies by fighting SEC regulations that target the industry.
Gensler, who has held the position for four years and who regularly took on the crypto industry, will step down in January.
Trump himself has dabbled in cryptocurrency. He released crypto-based digital trading cards – and Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates Truth Social, is reportedly close to acquiring crypto trading firm Bakkt. The Trump family launched its own crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, in September.

What to know about the top 3,2024-12-06,https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/12/06/altcoins-bitcoin-crypto-soars/76761002007/,"Make no mistake about it, Bitcoin has been the story of the year in the crypto market. Thanks to the launch of the new spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January, it has hit one all-time high after another, and it currently trades for just under $100,000. For the year, it's up 125% on December 3.
But a surprising number of cryptocurrencies are performing just as well. In fact, 12 of the top 20 cryptocurrencies, as ranked by market cap, are either keeping pace with Bitcoin or far surpassing it in overall returns. The three that are on my radar right now are XRP (CRYPTO: XRP), Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE), and Sui (CRYPTO: SUI).
The one altcoin that is absolutely on fire right now is XRP. It's up 440% over the past 30 days and is on the cusp of breaking through the $3 mark. It might not sound that impressive, given that Bitcoin is on the cusp of $100,000, but just a month ago, XRP was trading for only $0.50.
So what changed? The pro-crypto optimism surrounding the incoming Trump administration has worked wonders for XRP. The growing consensus now is that all the regulatory concerns that have swirled around Ripple (the company behind the XRP token) for the past few years should disappear soon, freeing it up to get back to business as usual.
Add in the fact that XRP could get a spot ETF next year, and it's easy to see why investors are excited. At least four different investment firms have now filed for a spot XRP ETF, including a new filing from WisdomTree on Dec. 2. As seen with the spot Bitcoin ETFs, the launch of new XRP ETFs could result in a tsunami of new money flowing into the crypto in 2025.
Dogecoin is still just a dog-themed meme coin that trades purely based on hype and speculation. But it deserves special consideration because it is the one meme coin that seems to be benefiting the most from the new Trump presidency. Over the past 30 days, Dogecoin is up 180%, and for the year, it's up 366%.
You can thank billionaire Elon Musk for that. Ever since he proposed the creation of a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Dogecoin has taken off.
Any good news surrounding DOGE (the government entity) is now showing up in the price of the crypto. For example, when Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, recently said that he would support DOGE's efforts to reduce wasteful spending, the price of Dogecoin spiked by nearly 10%.
The agency name can't be an accident, but there is no official link between Dogecoin and DOGE. While Musk has been a strong supporter of Dogecoin in the past, he has advanced no official strategy for including Dogecoin as part of a new Department of Government Efficiency. So invest at your own peril.
Sui is a Layer 1 blockchain network, similar to Ethereum and Solana, that had its official launch in May 2023. It stands out for its particularly fast transaction processing speeds.
At one time, Solana was generally acknowledged as the fastest blockchain in the world, but Sui has now surpassed it. As a result, Sui is commonly referred to as ""the next Solana.""
For the year, Sui is now up 371%, making it one of the top performers in the entire crypto market, beating out even XRP (up 340% for the year). A lot of that rise has to do with the rapid surge of Sui projects this year.
As long as it can snatch market share away from the likes of Solana and Ethereum, it should continue to attract the attention of investors. Given that it's currently just 1/40 the size of Ethereum in terms of market cap, the upside could be tremendous if Sui's success story has legs.
Looking ahead to 2025, the one development to watch is the planned introduction of a Sui-based handheld gaming console. That's because blockchain gaming could be the killer app to bring new users onto the Sui blockchain.
According to Sui, the gaming experience will be completely seamless, and users won't need to know anything about blockchain or crypto to get started. That's a big plus if the goal is mainstream adoption.
Of the three cryptos mentioned above, Sui is a strong buy, XRP is a hold and Dogecoin is a sell. Admittedly, XRP has been a rocket ship of late, and Dogecoin is showing signs of life for the first time in a long time. But these two cryptos, in my opinion, are just short-term momentum plays.
In contrast, Sui appears to have real legs for long-term sustained growth. Conceptually, it's easy to understand what it is, and what value it provides. If you understand Ethereum or Solana, then you understand Sui. And, with the planned introduction of a gaming console in 2025, it will have a new path to mainstream adoption.
But just keep in mind: Anytime you're venturing into the world of altcoins, the level of risk is highly elevated. All three of these cryptos are highly speculative plays. All of them are far outperforming Bitcoin this year, but the situation could change dramatically heading into 2025.

2024 began with significant momentum for cryptocurrencies, especially like Bitcoin and Ethereum, eliciting enthusiasm among crypto enthusiasts. As of Dec. 05, 2024, Bitcoin hyped to an exceptional all-time high at $103,900, with a market capitalization of $2.02 trillion, representing a 6.80% increase in the last week.
Bitcoin has surged due to certainty fuelled by the U.S. presidential elections and Republican candidate Donald Trump’s victory. BTC traded around $95,000 in the last few days after nearly touching $100,000. As of today, Dec. 05, 2024, it surged to the extreme high of $103,900. The anticipation that Trump’s administration will usher in a friendly regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies has fueled the surge. 
As of Dec. 5, 2024, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is trading at $102,706. After Trump’s victory on Nov. 5, the price has surged around 45%, driven by a swathe of buying and pouring capital into U.S. bitcoin-backed exchange-traded funds.

Bitcoin has endured a tumultuous period, shedding approximately 65% of its market value over the past year. Crypto enthusiasts were taken aback by unforeseen events such as the Terra Luna crash, FTX decline, macroeconomic factors, and Binance’s legal issues. Nonetheless, the crypto market exhibited a remarkable recovery toward the end of the year, with BTC showing promising growth. 
Bitcoin surged to impressive heights, surpassing its all-time highs multiple times following the U.S. presidential elections, reaching $103,900 as of Dec. 05, 2024. BTC ETF options on the Nasdaq may have also contributed to the surge. This surge propelled its market capitalization to $2.03 trillion, contributing to the overall crypto market capitalization of $3.69 trillion, reflecting exceptional performance.
After surpassing the psychological threshold of the $31,000 mark, Bitcoin started exhibiting a bearish trend and traded below $30K levels for most of the last year. However, it has shown remarkable recovery in the latter months of the year.
The world’s largest cryptocurrency, BTC, which was on a recovery path, has increased around 147.39% in one year. As of Dec. 05, 2024, it is currently trading at $102,658, with a market capitalization of $2.03 trillion and a global cryptocurrency market capitalization of $3.69 trillion.
Cryptocurrency experts believed that if BTC maintained its level of $30,000, it could likely bounce back from there. Looking at the current scenario, Bitcoin surpassed its all-time high in March but witnessed a downtrend later.
In April 2023, the top cryptocurrency Bitcoin, touched the critical resistance of the $30,000 level for the first time since June 10, 2022, and then started dipping below $26,000. It significantly rose to $45,203 after May 2022. Crypto experts believe that if Bitcoin maintains the $45,000 level and beyond, it could reach $60,000 by the end of 2024. In the first three months of the year, BTC has already touched the level of $73,750 and set a new record for an all-time high.
While the future of Bitcoin is unknown, retail investors must be very cautious about every move of Bitcoin, as it has witnessed tumultuous before. Moreover, India’s stance on cryptocurrencies continues to be firm, with the government bringing all crypto-related transactions under the ambit of the Money Laundering Act. In a specific gazette notification, the Union Finance Ministry of India stated that all the transactions related to digital assets or virtual currency would fall under the purview of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). 
The new development may appear damaging to the cryptocurrency community in India. However, the industry has praised the move as a step towards regulating this space. Without regulators, the enforcement agencies will immediately take recourse to any discrepancies. 
The Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been a tremendous factor in Bitcoin’s growth. After the SEC approved the ETFs in the U.S., retail investors showed great interest, leading to Bitcoin surpassing its all-time high. By the end of September, after the U.S. Federal Reserve’s rate cut, BTC is, as of Oct. 16, 2024, trading at $67,000. The U.S. Fed cut rates by 50 basis points, and the Bank of Japan kept interest rates steady. BTC rose around 3% a day after both central banks’ announcements.
One of the other reasons crypto experts were hopeful about Bitcoin is that this year, 2024, was a year for Bitcoin’s halving event. The Bitcoin halving event happens every four years, during which BTC rewards to its miners are cut by 50% (the miner’s payout will be reduced to 3.125 BTC). This event is usually positive for Bitcoin’s price, as it helps contract supply. 
Historically, halving has been seen as an excellent sign for bringing momentum to Bitcoin’s price. So far, this year’s halving that took place on April 20, 2024, has not caused the surge to the BTC, as experts anticipated. The current state of Bitcoin reflects a significant downtrend. 
Bitcoin Halving History
The above table shows that past halving events have established long-term bullish drivers for Bitcoin’s price. The Bitcoin halving event relates to its deflationary tendency and crushing its supply, which helps the Bitcoin price to rise further. As BTC is a decentralized cryptocurrency, any central banks or governments can’t print it, and thus, Bitcoin’s total supply is limited. 
Moreover, “Bitcoin Whales,” referring to large investors, have started accumulating Bitcoin again. According to data from CoinMarketCap, these large Bitcoin whales, holding as of Dec. 3, 2024, have 248.60K BTC in their wallets, indicating that investors have been filling their wallets with a substantial amount of Bitcoins. This accumulation may contribute to boosting the price of Bitcoin.

The year’s second half has been full of surprises and growth for cryptocurrencies. After the 2024 U.S. presidential elections, Republican candidate Trump’s race and victory have made people expect favorable regulations around crypto investment. The political change has made BTC reach its expected heights and surge past $100,000 in 2024, with few days left before the year ends. 
Himanshu Maradiya, chairman and founder of CIFDAQ, said, “Bitcoin’s leap past the $100,000 mark isn’t just a financial milestone—it’s a historic moment that cements the growing clout of decentralized assets in the mainstream. For investors, the spotlight now shifts to long-term planning: keeping an eye on market cycles, diversifying portfolios, and staying updated on regulatory shifts. 
While this breakthrough fuels optimism, he signals caution. “Seasoned investors see this as a chance to reassess risk strategies, while newcomers are urged to prioritize learning the ropes before diving in. The road ahead will demand both patience and conviction,” said Maradiya.

According to Binance’s price prediction input for Bitcoin, the value of BTC may increase by +5% and reach 137,394.62  by 2030. The consensus rating indicates a bullish current sentiment. This indication is based on 3857 users’ crypto ratings for Bitcoin (BTC); 36.71% of users are bullish on BTC.
Bitcoin enthusiasts often make overly optimistic and sometimes unrealistic predictions for their favorite cryptocurrency. After the surge, numerous discussions have occurred around Bitcoin, the world’s largest digital coin. 
Vikram Subburaj, chief executive officer of Giottus, said that speculation is rife about how high BTC can go, with many predicting $1,000,000. Gold has a market capitalization of $17 trillion, and BTC is highly unlikely to reach the $1 million mark in 2025. However, BTC hitting the $1 million mark in subsequent years cannot be ruled out.

Among the myriad predictions on Bitcoin, the bottom line remains that it has experienced several downfalls and has emerged stronger than before each time. Its resilient nature instills a belief in crypto enthusiasts who see value in investing in decentralized currencies. 
Only time can tell whether Bitcoin continues to rise or face downfall, and trading Bitcoin should be done with full awareness; your investment may yield a different return than the anticipated return.

Bitcoin’s value soared to new heights this week, extending a post-election surge as President-elect Donald Trump vows to boost cryptocurrencies. Wealth advisers and personal finance experts say they’re hearing from more people taking a fresh look at the market, but their advice remains: Dip a toe in, don’t dive headfirst.
“My POV on the risks and benefits of bitcoin hasn’t changed much, if at all,” said Samuel Deane, president and CEO of Deane Wealth Management, a financial advisory firm. “Though the incoming administration is pro-crypto right now, I’ve seen enough in politics to know that can change at any time.”
The price of bitcoin traded north of $100,000 late last week after clearing the six-figure threshold for the first time Wednesday, as investors bet on the next administration resetting the rules for an industry that has drawn scrutiny from regulators.
Trump, who swiftly took credit for the bitcoin milestone, named billionaire investor David Sacks a White House “crypto czar” and tapped crypto advocate Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission. The president-elect wrote on his social media app that Atkins “recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before.”
But for ordinary investors, the same old tenets apply, Deane said. While he’s a long-term bitcoin investor himself, clients who’ve added crypto to their portfolios are “doing it on their own after we establish the proper guardrails,” he said.
“First understand the basics of bitcoin as a decentralized digital currency,” he advised, which includes taking stock of its volatility. The token was trading at around $43,000 back in January and hovered around $70,000 days before the election — but around this time two years ago, it cost just $17,000. Investors have to decide if they can stomach such big swings, Deane said.
“This is something that’s been going on forever as it relates to the cryptoverse,” said Lee Baker, founder and president at Claris Financial Advisors. “You get these quick run-ups, but then you get some very sharp pullbacks. The thing you have to caution clients and other investors is that, ‘Hey, listen, you’ve got to be real careful to do this stuff in small doses.’”
Baker said his firm has received “multiple queries” from clients looking to learn about bitcoin as it surged following Trump’s win, but he’s heard more interest lately in other coins such as XRP, the cryptocurrency of the Ripple blockchain network, as well. He said he advises first-time crypto investors not to allocate more than 2% of their portfolios to bitcoin.
Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds can help limit direct risk and are often a good place to start, Baker said. These options are new, but there are already plenty of popular ones to choose from, such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which launched last year after the company won a lawsuit against the SEC that helped open the door to bitcoin ETFs. Some of those investment products have exploded since Trump’s re-election.
Yet, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell spoke skeptically of bitcoin this week, saying that it’s still widely treated “as a speculative asset.”
“People are not using it as a form of payment or as a store of value. It’s highly volatile,” he said. Contrary to what advocates have long argued, “it’s not a competitor for the dollar, it’s really a competitor for gold,” he said at a DealBook conference Wednesday.
Deane also sounded a note of caution amid the recent excitement: “Not every investment that does well needs to be a part of your portfolio.”
Crypto devotees, though, are feeling buoyant. Leaders in the space have credited Trump for bitcoin’s surge, heralding a new era of looser regulation after SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s impending Jan. 20 exit.
Gensler, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, has taken a hard-line approach to cryptocurrencies, which have contributed to a spate of cybercrimes and scams that the FBI says cost consumers billions of dollars last year alone. Under his leadership, the commission tried and failed to block bitcoin ETFs from hitting the market and also took major crypto exchanges to court in recent years, part of a controversial effort to assert more control over the sector.
For the crypto industry, “Gensler’s departure in and of itself was a positive,” said Isaac Boltansky, a director of policy research at the financial firm BTIG. “There will be a sea change ideologically at the commission and throughout government,” he predicted.
If confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term succeeding Gensler, Atkins is expected to take a similarly aggressive stance — just in the opposite direction, Boltansky said. He’ll be aided by two sitting commissioners, Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda, who previously worked with Atkins during his earlier stint at the SEC during the George W. Bush administration.
But despite the personnel changes, there are “still jurisdictional battles” to come, Boltansky warned, noting that the agency and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have sometimes stepped on each others’ toes over crypto regulation. “There are too many cooks in the kitchen, and they can’t agree on what they’re cooking,” he said. 
He added that the key question of whether cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities is still being worked through in the courts, beyond the reach of federal regulators. The answer will determine whether they can be treated like stocks. But Boltansky said the next Congress, which will be narrowly Republican-led, is at least likely to deliver more clarity on stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to that of another currency or commodity such as the dollar.
In the meantime, prospective investors should think through how and whether crypto fits into their existing progress on other financial goals, said Kevin Mahoney, a certified financial planner and founder of Illumint, a millennial-focused firm. Try to avoid being put “in a much less stable financial situation, or you’ve missed out on some of the other longer-term investments that you wanted to make, because you put too much in,” he said.
Rather than bet on what the government may or may not do, “I’d rather have my clients focus on what we know to be true, or what historical stock market data, for example, tells us is likely to be true,” he said. “That’s often going to be much more empowering for them and much more likely to succeed.”

Experts weigh in,2024-12-10,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/bitcoins-limited-supply-driven-rally-experts-weigh/story?id=116632191,"The price of bitcoin topped $100,000 for the first time last week.
When the price of bitcoin sailed past $100,000 for the first time last week, many observers attributed the milestone to crypto-friendly President-elect Donald Trump, including Trump himself.
""YOU'RE WELCOME!!!"" Trump posted on Truth Social.
The focus on a surge of demand for the world's largest cryptocurrency, however, risks overlooking the ever-present role played by a steadily approaching limit in bitcoin's supply, some experts told ABC News.
Digital architecture erected at the founding of bitcoin set a limit of 21 million bitcoins. As of now, about 19.8 million bitcoins have been created, leaving a fraction of the total left to be mined. A pre-set timeline for the availability of future bitcoins makes for a slow release of the remaining currency, with the limit expected to be reached around 2,140.
The price of bitcoin, like any asset, is driven by supply and demand. Experts who emphasize the role played by bitcoin's limited supply say scarcity makes up a key driver of the price, just as it would for water in a desert or an athlete's game-worn jersey.
Others point to the ebb and flow of investor appetite as the key price-setting force.
""The limited supply of bitcoin makes it attractive,"" Nikhil Bhatia, a professor of finance and business economics at the University of Southern California who studies cryptocurrency, told ABC News. ""That's why you see Malibu properties that go for $100 million-plus. People liked prized assets.""
Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, whose real-life identity remains unknown, set the rules for bitcoin at its creation in 2009. The algorithm underlying the cryptocurrency allowed for the release of 50% of yet-to-be created bitcoins every four years.
That approach made for a release of the majority of coins over bitcoin's initial years, followed by a long process of adding the outstanding currency that will stretch on for more than a century. Miners create new bitcoin by completing difficult computational tasks that require significant resources. For their work, they earn rewards paid in bitcoin.
The slow creation of new bitcoins makes the cryptocurrency sensitive to demand, since there is no source of readily available supply, Bryan Armour, the director of passive strategies research at financial firm Morningstar, told ABC News.
""When new demand is generated, if people aren't willing to sell, then that just means they'll have to pay a higher price to satisfy that demand,"" Armour said. ""It has been a huge contributor to the price increase.""
Some skeptics of cryptocurrency also point to the finite supply of bitcoin as its saving grace, since the digital asset has yet to be widely adopted for use in transactions.
""If one thinks about the underlying value proposition of bitcoin, it is driven entirely by scarcity,"" Eswar Prasad, a professor at Cornell University and the author of ""The Future of Money: How the Digital Revolution is Transforming Currencies and Finance,"" told ABC News.
""That is a fundamental underpinning of its value, because bitcoin has no intrinsic value since it isn't working very well as a medium of exchange,"" Prasad added.
By contrast, some analysts say the well-known trajectory of bitcoin supply is already baked into the asset's price. Instead, they point to ever-expanding investment in bitcoin by everyday people and financial institutions.
""Supply has played no role at all and the reason is very simple: The dwindling supply of bitcoin is predetermined so people have a very good understanding of how it evolves over time,"" Christian Catalini, founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab, told ABC News.
A surge in demand for the cryptocurrency over time may owe to investors' desire to share in the asset's gains, a belief in its utility as a store of value like gold or a hope for its eventual adoption as a means for buying and selling, some experts said. Regardless, they added, the demand for bitcoin makes up a crucial factor in setting its price.
""Even though bitcoin is scarce, it could be that people don't want to own this and its price could go to zero,"" Ariel Zetlin-Jones, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University, told ABC News.
The price of bitcoin surged nearly 50% after the election of Trump, who has vowed to deregulate cryptocurrency and establish the federal government's first National Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.
Previous gains this year appeared to be propelled, in part, by U.S. approval in January of bitcoin ETFs, or exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to buy into an asset that tracks the price movement of bitcoin, while avoiding the inconvenience and risk of purchasing the crypto coin itself.
""As you see the price go up, there's obviously been demand,"" Armour said. ""It's a very momentum-driven asset. When the price goes up, it generates more demand. When the price goes down, you see speculators either taking profits or cutting losses.""
""It ends up resulting in large price swings, which are synonymous with bitcoin,"" Armour added.
As recently as 2021, bitcoin suffered a downturn that cut its value in half. The same thing happened a year earlier, when the initial outset of the pandemic triggered a panic among investors. After topping $100,000 last week, the price of bitcoin has dropped below $96,000.
As with other other goods, it's difficult to determine the precise role played by supply or demand in setting the price of bitcoin, Zetlin-Jones said.
""In some ways, that's the final issue of all economics: What drives prices, supply or demand? It's really hard to disentangle,"" he said.

 Trump’s re-election has sparked a rally in bitcoin and advocates are upbeat about 2025. We look at the likely price drivers for the main cryptocurrency coin next year, the role that asset managers will play in bringing it into the mainstream and likely changes in the regulatory landscape.Bitcoin’s Rapid RevivalThe “crypto winter” of 2021 and 2022 now seems a distant memory. That was a major crisis for cryptocurrencies, and one in which the bitcoin price slumped below $20,000, losing 75% over 12 months.Such a turnaround is impressive, but the history of bitcoin is one of extreme highs and lows, says John Plassard, senior investment specialist at Mirabaud Group: “Bitcoin’s unprecedented rise reflects a blend of increased legitimacy and growing demand, but history suggests caution as bitcoin’s price trajectory has been marked by sharp corrections following periods of exponential growth.” Cryptocurrencies are known for their high volatility. Prices can fluctuate significantly in short periods, induced by factors such as market sentiment and risk appetite, regulatory news, technological developments, and macroeconomic trends. Indeed, Adrian Fritz, head of research at 21Shares, says that corrections are part of bitcoin’s history and vital for the price dynamic.“These downward adjustments, typically ranging from 20% to 40%, serve as a vital mechanism for reestablishing market equilibrium and are an integral part of bitcoin’s historical price patterns”. Dovile Silenskyte, director of digital assets research at WisdomTree agrees.“Investors should approach investing in bitcoin with the understanding that volatility is an inherent characteristic. This means being prepared for price corrections and potentially substantial declines in value, regardless of the current price or market conditions. “Investors should also recognize that volatility can work in both directions: while it presents the possibility of substantial upside gains, it equally entails the risk of significant losses.” Bitcoin: Opportunities And Risks in 2025 Making predictions about the price of cryptocurrencies is a very risky exercise. “In 2025, bitcoin’s future looks promising yet uncertain,” says John Plassard. “The growing integration of bitcoin into mainstream finance through spot ETFs and institutional adoption suggests it could consolidate its position as a legitimate asset class,” he says. However, its performance will depend on macroeconomic factors, market liquidity, and regulatory policies under the Trump administration. “If the current trajectory continues, Bitcoin could see further growth, though volatility and market corrections are likely to remain part of the narrative,” he adds.Among the possible positive drivers for bitcoin in 2025, WisdomTree’s Silenskyte also cites persistent inflationary pressures and monetary policy uncertainty as spurring interest in bitcoin as a “store of value”. Cheaper Money Could Head to CryptoAdrian Fritz says that as monetary policy eases in 2025, “increased liquidity in the financial system could also flow into digital assets, potentially driving up demand for bitcoin.” Fritz counters by highlighting that escalating geopolitical conflicts, particularly in the Middle East, could significantly dampen investors' appetite for high-risk assets. “The resulting economic uncertainty and market instability often push investors toward safer, more traditional assets, potentially triggering a sell-off,"" explains the 21Shares head of research. He also warns about the possibility of slower-than-expected implementation of pro-cryptocurrency policies by the White House.This “could lead to market disappointment and a price correction as many investors bet that the Trump administration will turn the tide of cryptocurrency processing in the United States”. Trump Pushes Pro-Crypto Regulation Indeed, the Trump administration is expected to play a significant role, as bitcoiners anticipate much more favorable regulation toward cryptocurrencies. Gary Gensler, current chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – historically averse to the crypto world and a proponent of much stricter regulation – will step down on Jan. 20, 2025. In his place, Donald Trump nominated Paul Atkins, who has been an advocate of cryptocurrencies for years. Trump has promised to make the United States the new “bitcoin hub”, and the US press speculates about names for leadership roles in the Department of Commerce, Treasury, and the SEC that are very supportive of the crypto industry. There are concrete plans for the establishment of advisory councils specializing in digital assets and also for the appointment of a “crypto tsar” who would be tasked with advising and regulating the industry. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is being discussed for this role. “These moves suggest a possible streamlining of regulatory processes and greater integration of digital assets into traditional financial systems, potentially fostering innovation and growth,” Fritz comments. Not Buying Bitcoin is Asset AllocationBitcoin has evolved into a full-fledged financial asset class over the last few years. Its market capitalization of USD2.03 trillion (£1.57 trillion) places it among the world’s largest assets, and the approval of spot ETFs in January 2024 in the US* has bridged the gap between crypto and traditional finance. “These instruments will continue to contribute to increased demand in the US as more private banks, hedge funds, and government pension funds add BTC to their portfolios, as evidenced by the SEC’s 13F filings over the past three quarters,” Adrian Fritz adds. Mirabaud’s Plassard adds that the entry of major asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity has “further legitimized bitcoin as a portfolio asset”. WisdomTree’s Dovile Silenskyte also says that institutional investors are increasingly recognizing the value of allocating a small percentage of their multi-asset portfolios to bitcoin.

The Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks is assigned based on an analyst's estimate of a stocks fair value. It is projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Morningstar assigns star ratings based on an analyst’s estimate of a stock's fair value. Four components drive the Star Rating: (1) our assessment of the firm’s economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock’s fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process culminates in a single-point star rating that is updated daily. A 5-star represents a belief that the stock is a good value at its current price; a 1-star stock isn't. If our base-case assumptions are true the market price will converge on our fair value estimate over time, generally within three years. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks, please visit here
Quantitative Fair Value Estimate represents Morningstar’s estimate of the per share dollar amount that a company’s equity is worth today. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is based on a statistical model derived from the Fair Value Estimate Morningstar’s equity analysts assign to companies which includes a financial forecast of the company. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is calculated daily. It is a projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Quantiative Fair Value Estimate, please visit here
The Morningstar Medalist Rating is the summary expression of Morningstar’s forward-looking analysis of investment strategies as offered via specific vehicles using a rating scale of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. The Medalist Ratings indicate which investments Morningstar believes are likely to outperform a relevant index or peer group average on a risk-adjusted basis over time. Investment products are evaluated on three key pillars (People, Parent, and Process) which, when coupled with a fee assessment, forms the basis for Morningstar’s conviction in those products’ investment merits and determines the Medalist Rating they’re assigned. Pillar ratings take the form of Low, Below Average, Average, Above Average, and High. Pillars may be evaluated via an analyst’s qualitative assessment (either directly to a vehicle the analyst covers or indirectly when the pillar ratings of a covered vehicle are mapped to a related uncovered vehicle) or using algorithmic techniques. Vehicles are sorted by their expected performance into rating groups defined by their Morningstar Category and their active or passive status. When analysts directly cover a vehicle, they assign the three pillar ratings based on their qualitative assessment, subject to the oversight of the Analyst Rating Committee, and monitor and reevaluate them at least every 14 months. When the vehicles are covered either indirectly by analysts or by algorithm, the ratings are assigned monthly. For more detailed information about these ratings, including their methodology, please go to here
The Morningstar Medalist Ratings are not statements of fact, nor are they credit or risk ratings. The Morningstar Medalist Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating an investment product, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what was expected, (iii) are not guaranteed to be based on complete or accurate assumptions or models when determined algorithmically, (iv) involve the risk that the return target will not be met due to such things as unforeseen changes in changes in management, technology, economic development, interest rate development, operating and/or material costs, competitive pressure, supervisory law, exchange rate, tax rates, exchange rate changes, and/or changes in political and social conditions, and (v) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the investment product. A change in the fundamental factors underlying the Morningstar Medalist Rating can mean that the rating is subsequently no longer accurate.

Topic:Cryptocurrency
Donald Trump was once a crypto sceptic. Now his re-election has sent the volatile price of Bitcoin sky-high.
These days, he's known as 37244-510. Not quite as catchy as SBF, the three-letter acronym mentioned in hushed tones back when he was revered as the richest man in the crypto sphere.
Sam Bankman-Fried once was the bold warrior in Bitcoin's battle for control of the future. He was the mop-top geek, the maths genius who threatened to up-end banking and finance and change the way we thought about business.
In the end, he went down for the oldest and most traditional of financier foibles, stealing money from his own clients.
These days, he is best known as the nerd who presided over one of the biggest financial frauds in American history.
When he was finally sentenced in March this year, Bankman-Fried was ordered to repay more than $US11 billion (more than $17 billion).
Had he managed to run his firm FTX like a legitimate business instead of a cash cow for his own amusement, he'd now rank amongst the world's richest after Bitcoin finally broke through the $US100,000 barrier.
Instead, he's now a resident of Metropolitan Detention Centre Brooklyn, living in a dormitory cell and reportedly working on an appeal against his 25-year sentence.
Given he was US President Joe Biden's second biggest donor in 2020, pumping through almost $US5.2 million in campaign contributions, an appeal for a pardon wouldn't be out of the question in the government's dying days.
But now there might be another source of salvation — Donald Trump and his most trusted adviser, Elon Musk, part crypto devotee, part puppeteer. When Musk's takeover for Twitter began wobbling, Bankman-Fried reportedly offered to help finance the bid with a $US5 billion loan.
And Bankman-Fried wasn't a one-party backer. He carefully played both sides of the political divide, and was a big Republican donor too, but opted to do so on the quiet because he thought the press was, as he put it, ""super-liberal"".
""I donated the same amount to both parties,"" he told the Guardian in 2022. ""All my Republican donations were dark,"" he said, referring to political donations kept off the public record. ""The reason was not for regulatory reasons, it's because reporters freak the f*** out if you donate to Republicans.""
Mistrust of the press is a sentiment that very much aligns with incoming president Donald Trump, whose sudden conversion to cryptocurrency has driven this latest boom.
Trump, once a sceptic who dismissed Bitcoin as a ""scam"", was in good company as a doubter.
Warren Buffet, considered the world's greatest investor, has described Bitcoin as ""rat poison squared"".
""I've seen people do stupid things all my life and I really, I empathise with that, they're going to play the lottery, they're going to get 60c back on the dollar and state, the numbers racket is something to be avoided,"" he told CNBC last year.
""I mean, people love the idea they're going to make more money tomorrow … the gambling instinct is so strong.""
In the past month, both the head of Australia's corporate regulator, Joe Longo, and Reserve Bank of Australia governor Michele Bullock have also voiced their concerns.
Longo told an Australian Securities and Investment Commission annual forum that Bitcoin was a good example of ""the bigger fool theory"" where the goal was to simply find a buyer prepared to pay even more for a worthless asset.
Bullock went further, arguing that, despite all the hype, it had no role to play in Australian society.
""Don't call it an alternative currency,"" she said. ""It's not a currency, it's not money, it's being used as some sort of asset class.""
""I don't understand it,"" she said. ""But, you know, I don't really see a role for it in, certainly in the Australian economy or payments system.""
Devotees dismiss these criticisms, arguing Bitcoin doubters simply don't understand.
But it's difficult to pinpoint any useful function Bitcoin serves. Initially, it was touted as a new means of exchange, a global monetary system that would make national currencies obsolete.
Bitcoin, however, is now a teenager — a geriatric in technology terms — and after 15 years, that hasn't happened, primarily because of its volatility.
Why spend Bitcoin on buying something if you think it will appreciate in value? And, as a seller, why accept it as a currency if you fear it might crash?
The same goes for its role as a store of wealth. It may be at record highs right now but, as this graph illustrates, it has fluctuated wildly over time in a series of booms and crashes that have undermined its ability to be a hedge against inflation and created as much poverty as it has generated wealth.
Instead, it has degenerated into a tool for speculators and gamblers.
Its defenders point to the role of blockchain, the unique ledger system that underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and its potential for wider business applications.
That may be a legitimate argument. But it doesn't justify the mania attached to cryptocurrencies. And when it comes to investment in new technology, it has been overtaken by the rush towards artificial intelligence and quantum computing.
Ironically, for all the hype that it would make national currencies obsolete, Bitcoin itself is still valued in US dollars. And those that trade it proudly measure their gains and their wealth in good, old style fiat currencies.
Trump is now a true believer, promising in his usual overstated mode that he plans to transform America into ""the crypto capital of the planet"".
The president-elect has even suggested creating a ""bitcoin reserve"" that could be used to pay off the country's $US35 trillion debt.
To encourage that, Trump and Musk are pushing for regulation around the crypto industry to be loosened, with Musk going so far as to suggest that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau be junked.
The president-elect, meanwhile, recently announced he would fire the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, on day one.
A noted critic of the crypto industry, Gensler decided he wouldn't hang around for the ritual humiliation and announced he would step aside the day Trump walked into the White House, leaving many to ponder whether the crypto industry's reported $100 million in Republican campaign funding would influence the decision on his replacement.
Gensler blazed a trail through Wall Street in a bid to stamp out conflicts of interest and boost transparency, launching court actions against multiple crypto firms.
What the incoming president has failed to grasp is that Gensler's actions have helped underwrite the latest surge in activity in cryptocurrency.
In January, with tighter regulation in place, the SEC gave the green light for old style financiers including Fidelity, BlackRock and Grayscale to launch what's known as exchange traded funds that invested solely in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
Once approved, those funds, which ordinary investors can trade on Wall Street and on the Australian Securities Exchange, then had to load up on Bitcoin, helping drive the price higher through most of this year.
Last week, Trump announced Gensler would be replaced by Paul Atkins, a noted crypto enthusiast. Unlike many of Trump's other appointments, however, Atkins is a well credentialed candidate with a background in law, years of experience in senior roles at the regulator and as a former SEC commissioner.
Nevertheless, he is expected to take a less aggressive stance towards the industry and possibly review many of his predecessor's court actions.
Endorsing Atkins on his own social media outlet, Trump said: ""He also recognises that digital assets and other innovations are crucial to making America greater than ever before.""
But there is a growing disconnect between Trump's stance on cryptocurrencies and his view of the US dollar.
The greenback is considered the global reserve currency. Everything else is priced against it, be it commodities like oil and metals or other currencies. That's something Trump wants to maintain as a symbol of American dominance even as he wants to retreat back into isolationism.
Just last week, he threatened to penalise any country planning to shift away from US dollar dominance, aiming specifically at the so-called BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) nations.
""We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty US Dollar or, they will face 100 per cent Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US Economy,"" Trump thundered on Truth Social.
But it was the debasement of the US dollar, through money printing, huge and ongoing deficits and soaring national debt — now approaching $US35 trillion — that led to the creation of Bitcoin in 2009.
Those deficits, and America's national debt, are expected to explode under Trump's high-protection and low-taxing policies, endangering his vision for ""The Mighty US Dollar"".
Investing in Bitcoin as a national reserve to repay that debt will only further undermine the greenback.
It's impossible to understate the scale of the Bitcoin frenzy which, once again, is beginning to feed on itself. The devotees now feel vindicated. The sceptics have been left bemused.
Back in September, Bitcoin was trading just north of $US53,000 a token. A fortnight ago, it punched through $US100,000, sending waves of jubilation through the legions of investors, many of whom were ambushed by the downturn two years ago when it plunged to just $US16,000.
Last month, more than $US10 trillion worth of digital assets changed hands on centralised exchanges as Bitcoin and its many imitators encroached even further into mainstream finance.
The latest boom fortuitously has coincided with the release of Changpeng Zhao — the brains behind the world's now biggest crypto exchange Binance — from a federal prison in California.
Incarcerated for four months after pleading guilty to breaching anti-money laundering rules, the man known simply as CZ once was Bankman-Fried's great rival and ultimately the architect of his downfall.
But the pair were not just business rivals. Prior to the implosion of Bankman-Fried's FTX empire, they frequently clashed on the subject of regulation.
Born out of a desire to overthrow the existing monetary system during the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009, Bitcoin's renegade mindset sat well with Zhao even after most countries declared his Binance empire off limits and outside the law.
Bankman-Fried figured the opposite; that for Bitcoin and the crypto industry to truly deliver, it needed to be accepted by the mainstream and be properly regulated. Ironically, it was his FTX that bit the dust while Zhao's Binance went on to global dominance.
While both this year were jailbirds, their financial fortunes headed in opposite directions.
Zhao has not only maintained his fabulous wealth, he's expanded it, amassing one of the biggest fortunes on the planet.
During the past year, according to data analysis from Newsworthyheadlines.com, Zhao's wealth grew more than six-fold to $US63 billion, mostly as a result of the Trump driven boom.
Even his stay in prison was profitable. As the rally tentatively took hold midway through the year, Zhao added about $US3 billion to his fortune, or an estimated $US25.6 million each day he was behind bars.
Who said crime doesn't pay?
Then there are meme coins, which have been around almost as long as Bitcoin but have no intrinsic value, earn no income and pay no dividends. And they proliferate.
Haliey Welch attracted fame midway through the year on a big night out with a girlfriend. A jovial on-camera quip about her special technique for pleasing her man was uploaded to social media and, in an instant, the Tennessee 20-something became a sensation.
Now, she's attracted a fortune. A fortnight ago, the so-called Hawk Tuah Girl launched a meme coin, a type of crypto currency that doesn't even pretend to do anything useful.
Within hours of the launch, the value of Hawk coin had soared to almost $500 million before suddenly losing 90 per cent of its value, wiping out most of its investors in a single day. Welch has since gone to ground.
Hawk coin has been criticised as a ""pump and dump"" or a ""rug pull"" where founders spruik the value to gullible buyers and create a buying frenzy before offloading everything.
The most famous meme coin is Dogecoin, created by two software engineers a decade ago, for the sole purpose of ridiculing Bitcoin.
To their utter dismay, it is still around and has been a favoured trading option for Elon Musk, whose new job in the Trump administration will be to jointly head DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency).
Driven entirely by social media hype, meme coins routinely soar and crash and, in an unregulated environment, are ripe for manipulation.
""Remember when cryptocurrency was so heavily and onerously regulated, so unnecessarily scrutinised by the authorities that the whole market crashed in spectacular fashion as one tightly regulated crypto platform after another collapsed into oblivion?""
""Yeah, me neither. Because that's not quite how it went, is it?""
Jemima Kelly, a columnist for The Financial Times posed this question in a piece late last month that injected a dose of reality into the current debate over Bitcoin and regulation.
When the market for cryptocurrencies crashed two years ago, what was exposed in almost every case was a web of deceit and incompetence, aided by loose or non-existent regulatory oversight.
Operating outside the finance industry mainstream, consumer protection and even licensing became an ad-hoc affair and, when the inevitable crash occurred, it hit hard.
Two years ago, they were falling like dominoes.
FTX, Celsius, Tether, BlockFi, Voyager Digital, Terraform, Luna. They all hit the skids, torching countless billions of dollars of investor cash.
The crashes were replicated around the world. Here in Australia, Blockchain Global, a cryptocurrency exchange, went under as funds and digital tokens disappeared.
In almost every case, the story was the same. Investor funds were plundered for other purposes, often plugging holes in other parts of the leaky structure. Often, they were used for personal largesse.
Despite the cloak of rebellion under which many hide, those running these outfits operate in much the same fashion as financiers and banks have done for thousands of years. They clip the ticket on transactions, charge fees for storage and gouge commissions at every opportunity.
Both Bankman-Fried and Zhao created their empires in this very traditional manner.
Financial institutions, whether they be traditional banks or cryptocurrency exchanges, thrive during periods of exuberance. Commissions on trillions of dollars of transactions adds up pretty quickly into handsome fees and huge profits.
Not surprisingly, there has been a sudden roar from those very crypto ticket clippers, some predicting Bitcoin is now on a trajectory to push past the $US1 million mark.
The not so subtle message is: ""Better get on board now.""
Mike Mangan discovered gold around the turn of the century.
Rattled by the dotcom bust and concerned by America's plunge into money printing to boost its economy, the Sydney-based former investment banker, stock analyst and funds manager turned to investing in the oldest form of wealth or, more specifically, those who mine it.
Gold, he explains, is a hard asset, a relatively unique metal because of its resistance to corrosion, it's malleable nature, visual attractiveness and its scarcity, all of which contributed to its use in coinage and jewellery, dating back thousands of years.
""It has a history, and history and reputation are so important when it comes to finance,"" he says.
That goes a long way to explaining why gold trading dwarfs the Bitcoin market.
But Mangan empathises with Bitcoin devotees, many of whom were left disillusioned by the near collapse of capitalism during the global financial crisis, and their search for an alternative.
""I wouldn't underestimate the cognitive dissonance of people wanting to find an alternative in a system they believe is going to hell,'' he explains.
The rise of Bitcoin, he says, ""reflects a loss of confidence in the monetary system"".
While global currencies no longer trade on a gold standard, most countries, and particularly China in recent years, continue to amass gold as a store of wealth.
America hasn't added to its gold reserves at Fort Knox for years but it holds the biggest reserves of any country by a long shot.
Like Bitcoin, gold too has punched through to record levels in recent months. Unlike Bitcoin, its rise has been steady during the past 20 years, providing a perfect hedge to the degrading of the US dollar and to inflation, as this graph in US dollars shows.
It also doesn't easily evaporate, as cryptocurrencies often do. And if in any future global conflict power systems and electricity grids are fried, the ability to retrieve a virtual asset — one that doesn't physically exist — will be compromised.
""Cryptocurrencies were supposed to be all about protecting yourself from a world in chaos,"" Mangan says.
""But if the world does descend into the kind of dystopian future many fear, what happens to your Bitcoin?""

Key Points
Tom Lee is the head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors. He correctly anticipated the stock market rally that lifted the S&P 500 out of bear market territory last year. Specifically, when Wall Street's median price target implied a 6% upside for 2023, Lee said the S&P 500 would gain 24%.
Lo and behold, the S&P 500 advanced by 24% last year as cooling inflation and the anticipation of interest rate cuts gave investors reasons to be bullish. More recently, Lee forecast that the S&P 500 would hit 6,000 in 2024, and predicted Bitcoin (BTC -0.66%) would top $100,000 this year. He was right on both counts.
Now, Lee is back with a shocking forecast for 2025: Bitcoin could hit $250,000. That would amount to an approximately 150% gain from its current price of around $100,000.
Lee earlier this year outlined his three-point investment thesis for Bitcoin during an interview with CNBC: First, he said, demand for it is still rising due to the growth of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs); second, the supply of newly minted Bitcoin has shrunk due to the recent halving of its block subsidies; and third, interest rates are falling, which is generally good for risk assets.
Spot Bitcoin ETFs: After the Securities and Exchange Commission gave its approval, 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs hit the U.S. markets in January 2024. Those funds let investors add Bitcoin to their existing brokerage accounts, which is easier (and often cheaper) than maintaining a separate account with a cryptocurrency exchange. Consequently, spot Bitcoin ETFs should continue to boost demand for the crypto among retail and institutional investors.
Indeed, Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at crypto index fund manager Bitwise Asset Management, recently wrote, ""Bitcoin ETFs are being adopted by institutions at the fastest rate of any ETF in history."" That is particularly good news for those who hold Bitcoin because institutional investors have $120 trillion in assets under management, and the price of Bitcoin should trend higher as they allocate more funds to it.
Analysts have declared spot Bitcoin ETFs to be the most successful ETF launches in history. But the iShares Bitcoin Trust by BlackRock has been particularly impressive. It hit $10 billion in assets faster than any ETF on record, according to The Wall Street Journal. It now has $35 billion in net inflows, which is more than the other 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs combined.
Bitcoin halving events: Block rewards are financial incentives that blend transaction fees and block subsidies (newly minted Bitcoin). Block rewards are paid to crypto miners for validating transactions, but the subsidies are reduced by 50% each time 210,000 blocks are added to the Bitcoin blockchain. That happens approximately once every four years.
These halving events are part of the system that limits Bitcoin's ultimate total supply to 21 million coins, and they decrease selling pressure by limiting the amount of newly minted currency that miners will be able to sell. The last halving took place in April, when Bitcoin traded at $64,000. But historically, Bitcoin's price chart has usually peaked one to two years after a halving. For instance, in November 2021, Bitcoin peaked at 690% above its price at the third halving, which took place in May 2020.
Interest rate cuts: In September, the Federal Reserve began lowering the federal funds rate, a benchmark interest rate that influences most other rates across the economy. Bitcoin has historically performed best in low-rate environments, perhaps because investors are more comfortable with risk assets when lending is less restrictive. That said, Bitcoin is a relatively new asset class, so the amount of historical data about it is limited.

In a recent interview with financier Anthony Scaramucci, Lee described Bitcoin as a hyper-volatile asset. To that end, Lee believes Bitcoin could see a pullback in early 2025, such that its price falls to $60,000. After that, however, he predicts it will increase to $250,000 before the year ends.
Also, Lee pointed out that Bitcoin typically makes most of its gains for each year within a single 10-day period. Crypto investors who miss out on those few days' gains would often wind up with a negative return for that entire year. In other words, it would be a mistake to buy Bitcoin without real conviction. Anyone who is likely to get scared out of the asset by a period of steep declines should avoid Bitcoin.
In closing, investors should bear in mind that no one knows the future. Lee has made prescient calls in the past, and he may be correct about Bitcoin hitting $250,000 in 2025. But investors shouldn't put a single cent into the cryptocurrency if they aren't prepared to lose it.

Bitcoin, the world’s biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, extended gains to a session high of $107,148 and was most recently at $106,877, up 5.43 percent from late Friday. The number two digital currency, Ethereum or Ether, was up 1.85 percent at $3,975.70.
“We’re in blue sky territory here,” said Tony Sycamore, an analyst at IG, an online trading provider. “The next figure the market will be looking for is $110,000. The pullback that a lot of people were waiting for just didn’t happen, because now we’ve got this news.”
Bitcoin and crypto have been catapulted into the spotlight as investors wager the incoming Trump administration will usher in a friendlier regulatory environment, boosting sentiment around the alternative currency. Bitcoin is up about 150 percent in 2024.
“We’re gonna do something great with crypto because we don’t want China or anybody else – not just China but others are embracing it – and we want to be the head,” Trump told CNBC late last week.
When asked if he plans to build a crypto reserve similar to oil reserves, Trump said: “Yeah, I think so.” He advocated the same move earlier this year.
Governments around the world held 2.2 percent of Bitcoin’s total supply as of July, according to data provider CoinGecko, with the US possessing nearly 200,000 Bitcoins valued at more than $20bn at current levels.
China, the United Kingdom, Bhutan and El Salvador are the other countries with a significant amount of Bitcoins, data site Bitcoin Treasuries showed.
Other nations have also been considering cryptocurrency strategic reserves.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier this month that many countries were turning to alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies.
“For example, Bitcoin, who can prohibit it? No one,” Putin said.

There are sceptics, though, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell likening Bitcoin to gold earlier this month. Analysts also point out that any such move will take time to implement.
“I think we still need to be cautious on a BTC strategic reserve, and at least consider that this is not likely to happen anytime soon,” said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, a trading platform.
“Of course, any comment from Trump that offers an increased degree of hope that plans for a strategic reserve are evolving is an obvious tailwind, but this would come with consequences which would need to be carefully considered and well telegraphed to market players,” he said.
Bitcoin has surged more than 50 percent since the November 5 US vote that saw Trump elected to office along with many other pro-crypto candidates. The total value of the cryptocurrency market has almost doubled over the year so far to hit a record over $3.8 trillion, according to CoinGecko.
Trump – who once labeled crypto a scam – embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet”.
Trump this month named a White House czar for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, former PayPal executive David Sacks, a close friend of Trump adviser and megadonor Elon Musk.
Trump also said he would nominate pro-crypto Washington attorney Paul Atkins to head the Securities and Exchange Commission.
On Friday, exchange operator Nasdaq said MicroStrategy, led by chief executive Michael Saylor, will be added to the Nasdaq-100 Index, with the change coming into effect before the market opens on December 23.
MicroStrategy, an aggressive investor in the world’s largest crypto asset, has seen its shares soar more than sixfold this year, taking its market value to almost $94bn. It is now the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency.
“The inclusion seems a bit unexpected, but that hasn’t stopped the excitement of what many believe to be the start of a looping cycle of capital that could potentially drive up the spot Bitcoin price,” said Matthew Dibb, chief investment officer at crypto asset manager Astronaut Capital.
MicroStrategy shares were up 4.2 percent on Monday.

Published: December 17, 2024 at 10:16AM EST
(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin reached an all-time high for a second consecutive day, with traders eyeing the $110,000 price level.  
The original cryptocurrency rose as much as 2.1% to $108,315 on Tuesday, before retreating back to its price at the start of the day around $106,000. It has surged more than 150% this year, and traders are increasing bets for further gains in the options market.
“We’ve seen buyers of $110k-$120k and $110k-$125k call spreads in Jan expiry, as well as rolling up of long strikes from $100k/$105k to 120k+ strikes,” said Shiliang Tang, president of crypto principal trading firm Arbelos Markets.   
Bitcoin reached the $100,000 milestone less than two weeks ago after President-elect Donald Trump announced his plans to nominate crypto-supporter Paul Atkins as chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Token prices have continued to rise as cryptocurrencies and crypto-related companies like MicroStrategy Inc. have seen greater institutional acceptance.
“Since late last week and the announcement of MSTR being included in the Nasdaq 100, as well as continued BTC open market purchases by MicroStrategy, capital rotation has largely benefited BTC dominance with BTC reaching ATHs and further pulling in more capital from the markets,“ Tang said.    
Crypto markets have seen large gains since Trump’s election victory as the industry expects a more friendly regulatory environment, and with Trump taking office next year, these tailwinds could continue.
“What is driving prices, it is the US election dividend, and in 2025 the prospects for the US owning Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset (likely not priced according to Polymarket which sees it as only 27% chance of happening), geopolitical instability, looser monetary policy — these factors are likely to remain supportive in 2025,” said James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares.
Other macroeconomic factors like the upcoming interest rate decision on Wednesday are also contributing to recent Bitcoin price movements.
With these factors, the market appears to be entering a new phase of price discovery for Bitcoin, according to Chris Newhouse, director of research at Cumberland Labs.
“We’ve observed relatively neutral funding rates throughout, and derivatives positioning that suggests some hesitancy around new highs,” Newhouse said. “While it’s difficult to say how quickly new catalysts — such as more structured regulation, stable frameworks for compliance, or even official government holdings — will be priced in, the stage is set for a revaluation of crypto’s long-term potential that goes well beyond the recent rally.”

The price of bitcoin has tumbled about 12% from a record high reached earlier this week.
After topping $108,000 for the first time on Tuesday, the world’s largest cryptocurrency dropped to a price below $93,000 in early trading on Friday. Bitcoin soon recovered some of those losses, settling around $95,000 at 9:30 a.m. ET.
The selloff rippled through the wider cryptocurrency market. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, ticked down about 1%. Lesser-known dogecoin fell 4% and crypto-trading exchange Coinbase fell nearly 2%.
The slide for bitcoin has largely come after the Federal Reserve announced late Wednesday that it expects fewer interest rate cuts next year.
Lower interest rates typically stimulate economic activity, drive up corporate profits and lift the value of forward-looking assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. In theory, a longer-than-expected period of high interest rates could diminish those returns.
The Fed’s forecast sent stocks falling within minutes and helped push bitcoin to its lowest level in weeks.
The recent slide for bitcoin erases some of the gains enjoyed since the election of former President Donald Trump, who is widely viewed as friendly toward cryptocurrency. Still, the price has climbed about 36% since Election Day.
Bitcoin had climbed to a new high earlier this week after Trump reaffirmed support for a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve.
A U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve would amount to a substantial government holding of bitcoin similar to the country’s stockpile of oil or gold. Bitcoin bulls expect such a potentially large acquisition of bitcoin to drive up demand and hike the price.
Supporters of a bitcoin strategic reserve also say the asset would help diversify the nation’s financial holdings, protecting it from the possible decline in value of other assets, such as the U.S. dollar.
Since the price of bitcoin is highly volatile, a large purchase of the asset could end up threatening the nation’s financial stability rather than safeguarding it, some critics say.
The major stock indexes rebounded on Thursday, recovering some of the losses they took after the Fed’s unwelcome forecast.

 The cryptocurrency market has had an extraordinary year, and market participants are optimistic about the prospects for 2025 as a new administration takes over in Washington D.C., though plenty of uncertainty remains.

 Bitcoin (BTCUSD) rallied early in the year amid explosive demand from newly launched spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Soon after, a bitcoin halving, which slowed the pace at which new bitcoins are created, created a demand-supply imbalance that sent prices soaring further. 

 The election of Donald Trump, as well as several crypto-friendly lawmakers, gave bitcoin another boost in recent weeks, helping the digital currency cross the $100,000 price mark for the first time.

 Here’s what market participants will be watching out for in the year ahead.

 One of the crypto market’s biggest concerns in recent years has been the lack of clarity around regulations and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) enforcement approach.

 On the campaign trail, Trump made a number of promises to the bitcoin and crypto industries, including that he would fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler on day one of his administration and establish a ‘Strategic National Bitcoin Stockpile.’ Gensler decided to step down and Trump has proposed crypto advocate Paul Atkins to head the agency.

 Even as markets await regulatory clarity, there is no guarantee they’ll get what they want or when.

 ""Trump’s stance on [decentralized finance (DeFi)] and crypto has been somewhat inconsistent,"" Delphi Ventures General Counsel Sarah Brennan told Investopedia. ""While he has expressed interest in the space, much of his focus seems limited to supporting dollar dominance and real estate applications."" The Bitcoin Dominance Index measures bitcoin's share of the overall crypto market valuation, and it recently hit new highs.

 According to Castle Island Ventures Partner Nic Carter, the legislative focus will be on getting stablecoin legislation passed first. Then, the focus will turn to the crypto market structure bill, which would clarify which crypto assets are commodities and which are securities.

 Analysts at Bitwise expect bitcoin to reach $200,000 by the end of 2025, while those at VanEck peg it at $180,000.

 Such predictions for bitcoin prices have been made many times in the past but seemed too ambitious. With bitcoin surging above $100,000, they may not seem so far-fetched now. 

 There are only 21 million bitcoins that can ever be created, and 19.79 million of them are already in circulation. While bitcoin supply is finite, demand for it has picked up.

 There is  growing demand for bitcoin from institutional investors that include ETF promoters, corporations and nation-states. Spot bitcoin ETFs have seen investors pour in $36 billion. MicroStrategy (MSTR), the leader for public companies holding bitcoin on its books, held 444,262 worth roughly $42 billion as of Dec. 23.

 Historically, bitcoin—and by extension the entire crypto market—rises and falls in line with the four-year bitcoin halving cycle. If that cycle were to hold, crypto markets would be due for a correction in 2025. But the presence of large institutional investors could limit any downturn.

 Bitcoin is in a “supercycle,” according to economist and Asgard Markets founder Alex Kruger, which means “recurrent 20%-40% corrections” instead of “85% drawdowns.”

 The Federal Reserve could also crash bitcoin's party. The central bank recently scaled back its expectations for interest rate cuts in 2025, which weighed on bitcoin prices. If the Fed slows down its rate cuts, Treasury yields could remain high, making them more attractive to investors compared to riskier assets such as bitcoin.

 Financial institutions are already taking steps to embrace a potentially friendlier regulatory environment by sending in applications for ETFs related to additional crypto assets, such as XRP (XRPUSD), moving beyond the previously approved ones for bitcoin and ether. 

 But it remains unclear if altcoins, or non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies, will join bitcoin’s party.

 The Bitcoin Dominance Index, which measures bitcoin's share of the overall crypto market, recently hit new highs for this crypto cycle.

 ""Historically bitcoin dominance has been cyclical,"" CoinFund Managing Partner and Head of Liquid Investments Seth Ginns told Investopedia. ""We’d expect a handoff to alts once bitcoin gets meaningfully above its all-time high, as happened in the last cycle.""

 MicroStrategy (MSTR) bought more bitcoin (BTCUSD) in the past week, making it eight weeks in a row that the company has acquired more of the digital currency.

 The software company-turned-bitcoin buyer said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Monday that it had spent around $209 million in cash to buy 2,138 bitcoin between Dec. 23 and Dec. 29 at an average price of $97,837. The company now holds 446,400 bitcoin.

 Shares of MicroStrategy, which joined the Nasdaq 100 last week, were down more than 6% in recent trading as the price of bitcoin fell. The cryptocurrency was trading at around $92,500 recently, down from highs last week of around $99,000 and an all-time high of $108,000 set two weeks ago.

 The bitcoin purchases over the past week were funded through at-the-market (ATM) share sales as part of MicroStrategy’s previously-announced ""21/21"" strategy. The 21/21 plan is the company's strategy of raising $42 billion of capital by selling new shares and fixed-income securities to buy more bitcoin.

 MicroStrategy also reported a year-to-date ""bitcoin yield"" of 74.1% in Monday's filing. That metric measures the growth in how many bitcoins per share MicroStrategy owns.

Bitcoin experienced a 150% rally in 2024, positioning itself as one of the top market performers in the year. This can be attributed to three bullish factors - regulatory optimism, an improved macro environment, and mounting investor enthusiasm. 
Looking ahead, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is expected to extend its bullish trend in 2025, with analysts projecting it may reach a price range of between $200,000 (€193,000) and $250,000 (€241,000). 
Bitcoin has historically reached fresh highs every 4 years during its past two bullish cycles since 2017. Each cycle saw gains of 2300% and 1700% before setbacks of between 70% and 80%. 
Since its low of $16,000 (€15,500) two years ago, Bitcoin has surged approximately 600%, indicating substantial potential for further growth in the coming two years. 
Tom Lee from Fundstart Global Advisors predicts Bitcoin could reach $250, 000 in 2025. The Standard Chartered projects the price to hit $200,000 next year.
Cryptocurrencies generally tend to move in a bullish trend during the easing monetary cycles of central banks. Investors’ appetite for risky assets typically grows in environments of increased liquidation and expanding money supply. 
With the world’s major central banks expected to continue cutting interest rates in 2025, prevailing risk-on sentiment is likely to support further gains for Bitcoin.
Regulatory developments were the primary drivers of Bitcoin’s price surge in 2024. Its price saw a substantial rally, surpassing the critical resistance level of $52,000 (€50,200) in February. 
It followed the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in January, ahead of the much-anticipated Bitcoin halving event in April.
Bitcoin traded between $52,000 and $72,000 (€69,600) until November, when Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election catalysed further gains. 
Trump’s pledge to implement crypto-friendly policies, including his statement that he would make America the “crypto capital of the planet”, boosted investor sentiment. 
Bitcoin topped the psychological threshold of $100,000 (€96,600) in early December after Trump announced plans to nominate Paul Atkins, a pro-crypto former SEC commissioner, as the next Chair of the SEC.
“That performance is likely to continue in 2025, we will have a clearer regulatory environment and we are seeing institutional capital come to the table in a more significant manner than we’ve ever seen,” said Josh Gilbert, a markets analyst at eToro Australia. 
The Trump administration’s policies could continue providing regulatory tailwinds for cryptocurrencies in 2025. The US president reiterated its plan to adopt Bitcoin as part of the US strategic reserves in December. The investment firm Charles Schwab expects Bitcoin to reach $1 million if this happens. 
At a July conference, the president-elect said Bitcoin holding would create ""a permanent national asset to benefit all Americans."" Senator Cynthia Lummis outlined the purchase of not more than 200,000 Bitcoin tokens annually over five years, or approximately 1% of the total supply. 
Based on its mining mechanism, Bitcoin has a maximum supply limit of 21 million tokens. Although the proposal did not clarify how it would pass the legal process, the US government could sell some of its gold reserves to raise the funds to buy Bitcoins, according to a Reuters report. 
Nonetheless, the long-term view may not alter the near-term correction risk. Bitcoin price has retreated sharply from an all-time high of above $108,000 (€104,300) in mid-December to the current $94,000 (€90,800) level. 
This is likely driven by profit-taking and risk-off sentiment. This decline coincides with a pullback in global stock markets over the past two weeks.
Until the incoming Trump Administration implements clear pro-crypto policies, some investors may choose to lock in their 2024 gains. 
From a technical perspective, Bitcoin’s immediate support level appears to be around $90,000 (€87,000). A breakdown below this level could see the cryptocurrency testing the next target of approximately $73,000 (€70,500).

The analysts at VanEck, Matthew Sigel (Head of Digital Asset Research) and Patrick Bush (Senior Investment Analyst), have just published their 10 predictions for the cryptocurrency market in 2025. Here’s a summary:
 We believe the crypto bull market will persist until 2025, reaching its first peak in the first quarter. At the cycle’s peak, we project Bitcoin (BTC) to be valued at approximately $180,000, and Ethereum (ETH) to trade above $6,000.
After this initial peak, we anticipate a 30% pullback in BTC, with altcoins experiencing more severe declines of up to 60% as the market consolidates over the summer. However, a recovery is likely in autumn, with major tokens regaining momentum and reaching previous all-time highs by year-end.
The election of Donald Trump has already provided a significant boost to the cryptocurrency market, with his administration appointing crypto-friendly leaders to key positions, including Vice President JD Vance, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins, FDIC Chair Jelena McWilliams, and HHS Secretary RFK Jr, among others.
These appointments mark the end of anti-crypto policies, such as systematic debanking of cryptocurrency companies and their founders, and the start of a policy framework that positions Bitcoin as a strategic asset.
Cryptocurrencies promise a better financial system through increased efficiency, decentralization, and transparency. We believe 2025 will be the year tokenized securities take off. There are already approximately $12 billion in tokenized securities on blockchains, mostly tokenized private credit securities listed on the semi-permissioned Provenance blockchain from Figure.
In the future, we see immense potential for tokenized securities to launch on public blockchains.
Stablecoins will evolve from a niche role in cryptocurrency trading to become a central part of global commerce. By the end of 2025, we project that stablecoins will settle daily transfers of $300 billion, equivalent to 5% of current DTCC volumes, up from $100 billion daily in November 2024. Adoption by major tech companies (like Apple and Google) and payment networks (Visa, Mastercard) will redefine the payments economy.
Beyond trading, the remittance market will explode. For example, stablecoin transfers between the U.S. and Mexico could grow 5x, from $80 million to $400 million monthly, driven by speed, cost savings, and growing trust. Stablecoins will serve as a Trojan horse for blockchain adoption.
We believe one of the most compelling narratives that will gain massive traction in 2025 is AI agents. These specialized bots help users achieve outcomes like “maximize returns” or “boost engagement on X/Twitter.”
AI agents optimize results by autonomously adapting their strategies. Protocols like Virtuals already provide tools for anyone to create AI agents for on-chain tasks. Virtuals allows non-experts to access decentralized AI contributors, like tuners, dataset providers, and model developers, enabling anyone to create their own AI agents. This will result in a massive proliferation of agents, which creators can rent out to generate income.
We are closely monitoring the emergence of Bitcoin Layer 2 (L2) blockchains, which hold immense potential to transform the Bitcoin ecosystem. These solutions enhance Bitcoin’s scalability by enabling lower latency and higher transaction throughput. Additionally, Bitcoin L2s introduce smart contract functionality, paving the way for a robust DeFi ecosystem built around Bitcoin.
Despite record volumes in decentralized exchanges (DEXs), DeFi’s total value locked (TVL) remains 24% below its peak. We anticipate DEX trading volumes will exceed $4 trillion in 2025, capturing 20% of centralized exchange (CEX) spot trading volumes, fueled by the proliferation of AI-related tokens and new consumer-oriented decentralized apps.
Tokenized securities and high-value assets will catalyze DeFi’s growth, adding new liquidity and utility. As a result, we project DeFi’s TVL will exceed $200 billion by year-end, reflecting the growing demand for decentralized financial infrastructure in a digital economy.
The 2022-2023 bear market hit the NFT sector hard, with trading volumes plunging 39% from 2023 and a staggering 84% from 2022. While fungible token prices began recovering in 2024, most NFTs lagged until a turning point in November.
Notable projects like Pudgy Penguins transitioned into consumer brands through collectible toys, while Miladys gained cultural prominence within internet subcultures. Similarly, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) evolved as a cultural force, attracting widespread attention from brands, celebrities, and mainstream media.
As cryptocurrency wealth rebounds, we expect affluent new users to diversify into NFTs, viewing them not only as speculative investments but as assets with lasting cultural and historical significance.
A constant theme of the 2024 bull market was the significantly better performance of Layer 1 (L1) blockchain tokens compared to decentralized application (dApp) tokens. For example, the MVSCLE Index, tracking smart contract platforms, gained 80% year-to-date, while the MVIALE Index of application tokens lagged with a 35% gain.
We expect this dynamic to shift later in 2024 as a wave of innovative dApps launches, offering new, valuable products that enhance their respective tokens. Key trends include AI-driven applications and decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), which hold immense potential to capture investor and user interest.
This shift highlights the growing importance of utility and product-market fit in determining the success of dApp tokens in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

 Bitcoin (BTCUSD) tumbled Tuesday after better-than-expect labor market data underscored the strength of the U.S. economy, dimming hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates.

 Bitcoin was trading $97,000 late Tuesday afternoon, down from an overnight high of nearly $103,000. The digital currency had moved above $100,000 on Monday for the first time in nearly three weeks.

 Risk-on assets, such as bitcoin and other crypto assets, tend to fall in conditions that are less conducive to lower interest rates, as it means there will be less money to throw around at such assets, and yields on bonds will be more appealing. The Fed has reduced its benchmark rate at each of its last three policy meetings—the first cuts in four years—but warned that the pace of easing will likely slow as inflation pressures persist.

 Bitcoin Opportunity Fund co-founder and Managing Partner James Lavish said in a post on X that investors are now also asking whether inflation could make a strong return in a manner similar to what was seen in the 1970s.

 Non-bitcoin crypto assets were down even more than bitcoin on Tuesday, with ether down 8% and solana down over 7% over the past 24 hours at the time of this writing. According to Farside Investors, inflows for the bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) neared $1 billion on Monday, as foreshadowed by the accompanying price rise. Ether ETFs also saw $128.7 million of inflows.

 In terms of crypto-related stocks, bitcoin treasury company MicroStrategy (MSTR) fell 10% on Tuesday and crypto exchange giant Coinbase Global (COIN) dropped 8%. Shares of bitcoin miner Marathon Holdings (MARA) slid 7%.

Santiago / Getty Images
 Stocks turned in a mixed performance on Wednesday, with major indexes fluctuating between slight gains and losses throughout the session, as investors prepare for the highly anticipated jobs report later this week.

 The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 rose 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.1%. Stocks were coming off steep losses on Tuesday, when surprisingly strong economic data sparked fresh concerns about where interest rates are headed.

 The sluggish performance comes ahead of a day off for the U.S. stock market on Thursday, which has been declared a national day of mourning to honor former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who died on Dec. 30.

 The ADP monthly private sector employment report this morning showed that fewer jobs were added in December than economists had anticipated, while weekly jobless claims also came in lower than expected. The numbers were precursors to Friday's highly anticipated release of the December jobs report. Market participants are watching the data closely for information that could affect the Federal Reserve's decision-making on interest rates.

 Data released Tuesday showed that there were far more job openings in November than economists had expected. That report, along with a hotter-than-expected reading on services sector activity, underscored the continued strength of the U.S. economy and raised concerns about whether the Fed will cut its key rate again. The Fed has cut rates at its last three policy meetings but has indicated that the pace of easing will likely slow as inflation has been stubborn.

 The yield on 10-year Treasurys, which is correlated with rate expectations, was down unchanged from the previous session at 4.69% in recent trading, after rising to 4.73% this morning, its highest point since April.

 Mega-cap technology stocks, which led Tuesday's selloff, were mixed on Wednesday. Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) gained ground, while Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (META) slipped.

 Among other major tech stocks, chipmaker Advancer Micro Devices (AMD) dropped 4.3% after a downgrade from HSBC. Software maker Palantir (PLTR), which was the S&P 500's top performer last year, fell 2.5%, adding to yesterday's 8% decline. The stock is down about 20% from its all-time high set on Dec. 24.

 Shares of eBay (EBAY) were the big gainers on the S&P 500 on Wednesday, rising 10%, after Meta announced it would allow eBay listings to appear on Facebook Marketplace in France, Germany and the U.S.

 Edison International (EIX) fell 10% and was the biggest S&P 500 decliner, as the company's Southern California Edison subsidiary was forced to shut off power to nearly 70,000 customers because of the Los Angeles-area wildfires.

 Shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), one of the world's largest holders of bitcoin, were down 2.9% as the digital currency continued to slump.

 Bitcoin was at $95,200 late Wednesday afternoon, down from an overnight high of around $97,000 and well below its Monday high of near $103,000. Bitcoin fell as low as $92,500 on Wednesday.

 Gold futures were up 0.5% at $2,680 an ounce, while WTI crude oil futures were down more than 1%.

GE HealthCare Gains After Analyst Names in 'Franchise Pick'
 GE HealthCare Technologies (GEHC) shares gained Wednesday after Jefferies analysts called the stock a “franchise pick” and made a bullish case for the company’s diagnostic imaging business.

 Jefferies bumped its rating for the stock up to “buy” from “hold,” and raised its price target to $103 from $95, bringing it above the broader analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha at about $95.

 Shares rose 3.5% to close at $86.26 Wednesday. The stock has gained 12% over the past year, about half as much as the S&P 500 over that period.

TradingView
 The analysts said the firm holds a leading position in the diagnostic imaging market, which they expect to grow by mid-single digits. GE HealthCare could also benefit from market consolidation, they noted.

 Jefferies added that improving business in China ""could be another icing on the cake.” China makes up 12% of the company’s sales, and GE HealthCare said in October that macroeconomic weakness in the country negatively impacted third-quarter sales.

EBay Soars as Meta Allows Listings on Facebook Marketplace
 Shares of eBay (EBAY) surged Wednesday after Meta Platforms (META) said some listings on the auction site will be included in Facebook Marketplace.

 Meta is launching a test program allowing users in the U.S., France, and Germany to view eBay listings on Facebook Marketplace and then complete their purchases on eBay.

 The move to add eBay listings comes after Meta was fined nearly 800 million euros ($825 million) in November by the European Commission, which accused the company of harming other classified marketplace providers by linking Marketplace to Facebook. 

 “While we disagree with and continue to appeal the European Commission’s decision on Facebook Marketplace, we are working quickly and constructively to build a solution which addresses the points raised,” Meta said Wednesday.

 Adding eBay listings ""could benefit people using both platforms"" by increasing the reach of eBay listings and giving Marketplace customers more options, the company added.

TradingView
 EBay's stock price jumped nearly 10% Wednesday to close at $69.40, its highest level since November 2021.

AMD Slides After Double Downgrade from HSBC
 Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares tumbled Wednesday after HSBC analysts gave the stock a double downgrade, citing concerns about the chipmaker's artificial intelligence (AI) revenue.

 HSBC dropped AMD’s rating two levels, to “reduce” from “buy,” and lowered its price target to $110 from $200.

 The stock fell 4.3% to finish at $121.84. The AI chip company’s shares have lost about 30% of their value over the past three months, while the S&P 500 has gained nearly 3% over that stretch.

TradingView
 The analysts called AMD’s AI chip roadmap “less competitive” than previously anticipated, pointing to soft demand for its MI325 graphics processing unit (GPU). A new MI350 chip is expected from AMD later this year, but the analysts added it could struggle to compete with AI chipmaking titan Nvidia's (NVDA) offerings. 

 HSBC lowered its fiscal 2025 AI GPU revenue forecast for AMD to $8.1 billion from $12.3 billion, well below the $9.5 billion analyst consensus. AMD is expected to report 2024 fourth-quarter earnings in late January or early February, based on the timing of its results last year.

Quantum Computing Stocks Sink After Nvidia CEO Comments
 Several stocks across the quantum computing industry, including Rigetti Computing (RGTI), D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), IonQ (IONQ), and Quantum Computing (QUBT), fell sharply Wednesday following comments from Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang about the technology.

 Huang said at an analyst event Tuesday that ""very useful quantum computers,"" which could make a number of computing tasks more efficient, are likely 15 to 30 years away.

 ""If you kind of said 15 years for very useful quantum computers, that would probably be on the early side,"" Huang said. ""If you said, you know, 30, it’s probably on the late side. But if you picked 20, I think a whole bunch of us would believe it.""

Artur Widak / NurPhoto / Getty Images
 Huang also said Nvidia is an ideal partner for quantum computing companies because ""it turns out that you need a classical computer to do error correction with the quantum computer, and that classical computer better be the fastest computer that humanity can build, and that happens to be us.""

 D-Wave Quantum was down 37% late Wednesday afternoon, while Rigetti, IonQ, and Quantum all declined around 40%. The Defiance Quantum (QTUM) exchange-traded fund (ETF), made up of the listed companies along with other chip and tech companies like Nvidia, was down nearly 5%.

 Those stocks ended 2024 on a substantial bull run after Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) last month revealed a quantum computing chip called Willow that the tech giant said had made significant breakthroughs.

Edison International Stock Plunges as LA Fires Cause Power Shutoffs
 Shares of Edison International (EIX) plunged Wednesday as its Southern California Edison subsidiary was forced to shut off power to nearly 70,000 customers because of the Los Angeles-area wildfires.

 At least two people have died because of the blazes, and the Los Angeles Fire Department said that the winds associated with the Palisades Fire ""are forecasted to remain extreme today and all residents are asked to follow evacuation orders.""

 According to Southern California Edison's website recently on Wednesday, there currently are 107 power outages and 69,601 customers affected.

 ""This is the third time in as many months that strong Santa Ana winds have prompted Southern California Edison to cut power to its customers,"" the Los Angeles Times reported.

 Edison International shares were down nearly 13% in recent trading, leading S&P 500 decliners. With Wednesday's sharp declines, shares of Edison International have fallen into negative territory over the past year.

Novo Nordisk Rises as UBS Upgrades Stock to 'Buy'
 Novo Nordisk (NVO) shares rose Wednesday after analysts from UBS Research upgraded the Danish drugmaker's stock to ""buy"" from ""neutral,"" calling the recent sell-off of the stock ""overdone.""

 UBS analysts upgraded the stock but lowered their price target for the company's domestic shares, listed in Copenhagen, to 750 Danish kroner ($103.55) from 1,100 kroner. The stock closed at 619.50 kroner at home Wednesday, about 40% below its June 25, 2024, record close of 1,028 kroner.

 The UBS analysts said that decline provides ""an attractive entry point,"" as they expect the weight-loss drug market to pick up in the first quarter of this year. Novo Nordisk is a leader in that market with its Ozempic and Wegovy drugs, along with its main competitor, Eli Lilly (LLY), and its Mounjaro and Zepbound.

 Shares of Novo Nordisk fell nearly 18% in one day last month after results of a trial for its newest weight-loss drug disappointed. The analysts called the trial results ""undoubtedly disappointing,"" but said the drug still looks to be a more effective weight-loss treatment than Ozempic that could ""still show differentiation"" in treating other diseases like type 2 diabetes in future trials.

TradingView
 Under its new price target, the analysts said they are projecting ""risk adjusted peak sales"" of $75 billion annually to 2031, rather than $80 billion previously. The sales projection was lowered because of the upcoming expiration of patents for Novo Nordisk's drugs in 2031 in Europe and 2032 in the U.S., which they expect will lead to lower sales, along with the recent weak trial results.

 Novo Nordisk's Copenhagen-listed shares closed up roughly 2.8% Wednesday, while its U.S.-listed shares recently were up more than 2%.

ExxonMobil Says Lower Oil Prices Will Hit Q4 Results
 ExxonMobil (XOM) said it expects to take an up to a $900 million hit to its upstream earnings in the fourth quarter versus the previous three months amid falling oil prices.

 Lower liquids prices are set to bring down its upstream earnings by between $500 million to $900 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared with the third quarter, the oil giant said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

 The forecasted earnings hit follows the oil company’s announcement last month that it is doubling down on its commitment to pumping more oil and gas. The long-term plan focuses on taking advantage of its nearly $60 billion purchase of Pioneer Natural Resources last year, it said. 

 ExxonMobil's forecast is also happening at a time when demand for oil is soft and there is an oversupply of the commodity. Last month, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) announced they will keep voluntary production cuts of 2.2 million barrels per day (B/D) in place until the end of March.

TradingView
 ExxonMobil shares were down 1.4% in recent trading. The stock has fallen 12% over the past three months.

Instacart Rises on News of S&P MidCap 400 Inclusion
 Shares of Instacart rose Wednesday on the news that the food-delivery stock will join a new index. 

 Instacart's stock was recently up about 5%. The rise followed the announcement late yesterday that the company, also known as Maplebear (CART), will join the S&P MidCap 400 index starting with next Tuesday's session, replacing Enovis (ENOV).

 Shares of Instacart are have nearly doubled over the past 12 months. 

 Instacart separately said Wednesday that it would partner with Ulta Beauty (ULTA) to deliver the latter company’s beauty products nationwide.

 Ulta's shares were recently down more than 3%; the company recently said its CEO would retire. 

 Enovis will move to the SmallCap 600 index, replacing Arch Resources (ARCH), which is soon expected to be acquired by Consol Energy (CEIX) and create Core Natural Resources. 

 Shares of Enovis were up more than 1% in morning trading.

Palantir Levels to Watch as Stock Continues Sliding
 Shares in Palantir Technologies (PLTR) were down again Wednesday after falling sharply yesterday, as the stock continues to retreat from its record high set in late December.

 Recent selling in the shares comes after investment bank Morgan Stanley initiated coverage on the stock earlier this week with an “underweight” rating and reports surfaced that Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management tech funds had sold shares in the company.

 The analytics software provider had a stellar 2024, ending the year as the S&P 500’s best performing stock. Its shares more than quadrupled, boosted by growing demand for its suit of AI software products.

 Palantir shares were down 3% at around $68 in recent trading, after falling nearly 8% on Tuesday. The stock is down 20% from its Dec. 24 all-time high.

 The stock broke down from a rising wedge in late December and has recently found renewed selling pressure on a retest of the pattern's lower trendline.

 Investors should watch crucial support levels on Palantir's chart around $66. $59, and $45, while also monitoring a major resistance area near $81.

 The cryptocurrency has lost ground as stronger-than-expected economic data has driven up Treasury yields, putting downward pressure on risk-on assets such as bitcoin amid investor concerns that the Federal Reserve may not cut interest rates again.

 Notably, on Wednesday, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded their second-largest daily outflows since they began trading last January, indicating caution toward the asset class among institutional investors.

 Bitcoin has more than doubled over the past year, with the cryptocurrency surging about 33% since November’s election amid expectations that the incoming Trump administration and a crypto-friendly Congress will pave the way for a more-favorable regulatory landscape.

 Bitcoin was trading at $93,500 late Thursday, down slightly from the day before and well below the high for the week on Monday of near $103,000. The cryptocurrency set an all-time high of around $108,000 in mid-December.

 Below, we break down the technicals on bitcoin’s chart and point out important price levels to watch out for.

 Since setting an all-time high (ATH), bitcoin’s price has come under significant selling pressure. More recently, the cryptocurrency’s price formed a bearish engulfing pattern to halt last week’s rally back above the closely watched $100K level.

 In addition, the relative strength index (RSI) has dropped below the 50 threshold and the price has fallen decisively under the respected 50-day moving average (MA), signaling weakening buying momentum.

 Let’s turn to bitcoin’s chart to identify key support and resistance levels that investors will likely be following closely.

 The first support level to eye sits around $92,000. This area may find buying interest near the late-November retracement low and December trough, as well as from the lower trendline of a potential new descending channel forming on the chart.

 Selling below the location could see a move down to the $87,000 level, a location on the chart where bitcoin bulls may seek entry points beneath a pennant pattern that preceded the cryptocurrency’s move to its record high.

 A decisive close below this level opens the door for a drop to around $74,000. Longer-term investors could look to accumulate the cryptocurrency in this region near the 200-day MA and prominent peaks in March and October. Such a move would represent a correction of around 20% from current prices.

 Returning bullish momentum could see another attempt at the psychological $100K mark, though this area on the chart may provide overhead resistance near a range of recent peaks and the descending channel’s upper trendline.

 Buying above this level could prompt a retest of the important $106,000 level. Traders who have bought the latest pullback may look to lock in profits around this level.

 In their first full year of trading, spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds may have fundamentally altered the way investors view cryptocurrency investments.

 Spot bitcoin ETFs began trading on Jan 11, 2024, opening up the crypto market to a wider range of investors and paving the way for more such products. The launch also played a role in boosting the price of bitcoin (BTCUSD) to a series of record highs, as investors poured billions into the ETFs.

 Here's what's happened since the launch of spot bitcoin ETFs.

 Spot bitcoin ETFs made it easier for investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency.

 Typically, if you wanted to buy bitcoin, you would need a cryptocurrency wallet and need to buy the token off a cryptocurrency exchange. Instead, if you opt for a bitcoin ETF, you can buy the product using your brokerage account like you would for any other ETF.

 Investors have appreciated that ease and poured billions into spot bitcoin ETFs. That enthusiasm is shared by retail and institutional investors alike, with even traditional Wall Street firms and hedge funds getting in on the action.

 Bitcoin is often referred to as digital gold, and bitcoin ETFs are quickly gaining popularity over gold ETFs.

 Blackrock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is one of the more popular ETFs, with net inflows so far exceeding $37 billion. The fund has seen tremendous growth with assets at over $52 billion as of Jan. 9, significantly surpassing the $33 billion in assets for the iShares' 20-year old gold ETF (IAU), and closing in on SPDR Gold Shares (GLD)—the largest gold ETF with assets over $75 billion.

 Spot bitcoin ETFs hold the cryptocurrency as the underlying asset. So as more people put money into the ETF, the ETF has to buy more bitcoin. That demand helped drive bitcoin prices to record highs last year.

 Bitcoin was trading close to $46,000 on Jan. 10, when the Securities and Exchange Commission gave its approval for bitcoin ETFs to begin trading. Its price fell below $40,000 in the first few weeks after the ETFs started trading, but then recovered to establish a new high of over $73,000 in March ahead of the bitcoin halving.

 Bitcoin halving, an event that occurs roughly every four years, slows the pace at which new bitcoin are created. Tighter supply and roaring demand from the ETFs created an imbalance, driving prices higher.

 Donald Trump's victory in the November presidential election provided an additional jolt, amid investor hopes that a crypto-friendly White House and Congress will adopt policies that support the asset class. Bitcoin hit multiple all-time highs in the weeks after the election, rising as high as $108,000 in mid-December. The digital currency was at $95,000 on Friday afternoon.

 The success of the spot bitcoin ETFs has also led to the approval of other regulated, crypto-focused financial products such as spot ether ETFs (ETHUSD) and options trading on the spot bitcoin ETFs.

 The Trump administration, which is scheduled to take control on January 20th, is expected to relax crypto regulatory restrictions, which could lead to the approval of more crypto ETFs.

 There are already proposals for XRP (XRPUSD) and Solana (SOLUSD) ETFs that have been sent to the SEC. Additionally, ETF analysts from Bloomberg see the potential for Litecoin (LTCUSD) and Hedera (HBARUSD) to have ETFs approved in 2025, following the approval of a combined bitcoin and ether ETF.

Bitcoin and crypto prices have bounced back, with bitcoin surging toward $100,000 after a sudden downturn sparked fears of a crypto crash.

The bitcoin price rocketed higher in the aftermath of Donald Trump's election victory in November, with Trump last month confirming he's planning to drop a bitcoin price bombshell.
Now, as the Federal Reserve braces for a looming crisis, Trump, the self-styled crypto president, will reportedly issue several crypto-related executive orders on his first day back in the White House, January 20—with one predicted to spark a huge bitcoin price boom.

Incoming U.S. president Donald Trump has reportedly made it priority to issue several bitcoin and ... More crypto executive orders—predicted to send the bitcoin price soaring.
Trump's day-one executive orders may address issues including de-banking and the repeal of a controversial crypto accounting policy requiring banks holding bitcoin and crypto to count them as liabilities on the bank's own balance sheet.
""The Trump team has made it very clear that this is a priority,"" an anonymous source told the Washington Post.
01/15 update: Bitcoin has surged following the latest U.S. data that showed headline prices climbed as expected but core inflation, striping out food and fuel, came in slightly below predictions.
The bitcoin price has rocketed toward $100,000 per bitcoin, almost entirely erasing its early January decline.
The inflation data means the Federal Reserve may be more inclined than previously thought to reduce interest rates through 2025, feeding risk assets such as bitcoin with increased liquidity.
""Bitcoin is also currently undergoing a local test as its price surpasses the $97,000 mark,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst, said in comments ahead of the inflation data drop. ""It is now challenging the 50-day moving average from below, a level it dropped beneath just over a week ago. The rally, with global equity indices relatively neutral, indicates a gradual recovery in risk appetite.""
The bitcoin price recovery from a dip last week, may now have ""run its course,"" according to Geoff Kendrick, head of crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, who maintained his bullish bitcoin price prediction for 2025 in an emailed note.
""We would recommend accumulating longs again,"" Kendrick wrote. ""We continue to target bitcoin at the $200,000 level by end-2025 as institutional inflows resume under the Trump administration.""
The mysterious, unconfirmed so-called ""Operation ChokePoint 2.0""—named for a similar, 2013 U.S. Department of Justice policy to de-bank legal industries deemed to be high risk for fraud and money laundering—has weighed on crypto companies through the Biden administration, with founders and executives claiming financial regulators have pressured banks to cut off crypto companies from financial services.
The issue was recently catapulted into mainstream consciousness by venture capitalist Marc Andreessen's appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast.
Andreessen, who has backed many tech and crypto companies at the VC company known as a16z and is an associate of Trump's so-called crypto czar David Sacks, is reportedly working with Trump’s incoming administration behind the scenes.
Meanwhile, crypto companies led by MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor have been campaigning against the policy that requires companies to report crypto as a liability, a result of a March 2022 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff accounting bulletin, SAB121.
The repeal of SAB121 is one of the three catalysts Saylor said would trigger a bitcoin price rally to $5 million—giving bitcoin a total market capitalization of $100 trillion.

The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, with the November election of Donald Trump push ... More bitcoin sharply higher.
Last year, Saylor, who has transformed his software company into a bitcoin-buying vehicle over the last five years, said during an X broadcast that the repeal of SAB121 will help ""take us to $5 million a coin"" as companies and financial institutions begin buying bitcoin.
""The other two [catalysts named by Salyor] have already happened (spot [exchange-traded funds] ETFs and fair value accounting),"" Julian Fahrer, the chief executive of bitcoin rewards company Apollo, posted to X.
Last year, the world's largest asset manager BlackRock led a Wall Street rush into the newly approved spot bitcoin ETFs, with its IBIT bitcoin fund becoming one of the fastest growing ETFs of all time as traders piled in.
In November, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) officially adopted fair value accounting for bitcoin, allowing companies to more accurately reflect bitcoin's current market value in their financial statements.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The price of bitcoin topped $100,000 again early Friday as a pumped up cryptocurrency industry expects early action by Donald Trump when he’s sworn in as president next week.
Once a skeptic who said a few years ago that bitcoin “seems like a scam,” Trump has embraced digital currencies with a convert’s zeal. He’s launched a new cryptocurrency venture and vowed on the campaign trail to take steps early in his presidency to make the U.S. into the “crypto capital” of the world.
His promises including creating a U.S. crypto stockpile, enacting industry-friendly regulation and event appointing a crypto “czar” for his administration.
“You’re going to be very happy with me,” Trump told crypto-enthusiasts at a bitcoin conference last summer.

Bitcoin is the world’s most popular cryptocurrency and was created in 2009 as a kind of electronic cash uncontrolled by banks or governments. It and newer forms of cryptocurrencies have moved from the financial fringes to the mainstream in wild fits and starts.
The highly volatile nature of cryptocurrencies as well as their use by criminals, scammers and rogue nations, has attracted plenty of critics, who say the digital currencies have limited utility and often are just Ponzi schemes.
But crypto has so far defied naysayers and survived multiple prolonged price drops in its short lifespan. Wealthy players in the crypto industry, which felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, spent heavily to help Trump win last November’s election. Bitcoin has surged in price since Trump’s victory, topping $100,000 for the first time last month before briefly sliding down to about $90,000 earlier this week. Two years ago, bitcoin was trading at about $20,000.
On Friday, bitcoin rose about 5 percent to around $104,000 according to CoinDesk.
Trump’s picks for key cabinet and regulatory positions are stocked with crypto supporters, including his choice to lead the Treasury and Commerce departments, as well as the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Key industry players are throwing a first ever “Crypto Ball” Friday evening, which promised on its website to include “an elite lineup of musical entertainment” to celebrate the first “crypto president.” The event is sold out, with tickets costing several thousand dollars.
Here’s a look at some detailed action Trump might take in the early days of his administration:
As a candidate Trump promised that he would create a special advisory council tasked with providing guidance on creating “clear” and “straightforward” regulations surrounding crypto within the first 100 days of his presidency.
Details about the council and its membership are still unclear, but after winning November’s election, Trump named tech executive and venture capitalist David Sacks to be the administration’s crypto “czar.” Trump also announced in late December that former North Carolina congressional candidate Bo Hines will be the executive director of the “Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets.”
At last year’s bitcoin conference, Trump told crypto supporters that new regulations “will be written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry.” Trump’s pick to lead the SEC, Paul Atkins, has been a strong advocate for cryptocurrencies.
Crypto investors and companies chafed as what they said was a hostile Biden administration that went overboard in unfair enforcement actions and accounting policies that have stifled innovation in the industry — particularly at the hands of outgoing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler.
“As far as general expectations from the Trump Administration, I think one of the best things to bet on is a tone change at the SEC,” said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the executive director of the advocacy group Coin Center.
Gensler, who is set to depart as Trump takes office, said in a recent interview with Bloomberg that he’s proud of his office’s actions to police the crypto industry, which he said is “rife with bad actors.”
Trump also promised that as president he’ll make sure the U.S. government stockpiles bitcoin, much like it already does with gold. At the bitcoin conference earlier this summer, Trump said it the U.S. government would keep, rather than auction off, the billions of dollars in bitcoin it has seized through law enforcement actions.
Crypto advocates have posted a draft executive order online that would establish a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” as a “permanent national asset” that would be administered by the Treasury Department through its Exchange Stabilization Fund. The draft order calls for the Treasury Department to eventually hold at least $21 billion in bitcoin.

Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming previously proposed legislation mandating the U.S. government stockpile bitcoin, which advocates said would help diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risks. Critics say bitcoin’s volatility make it a poor reserve.
Creating such a stockpile would also be a “giant step in the direction of bitcoin becoming normalized, becoming legitimatized in the eyes of people who don’t yet see it as legitimate,” said Zack Shapiro, an attorney who is head of policy at the Bitcoin Policy Institute.
At the bitcoin conference earlier this year, Trump received loud cheers when he reiterated a promise to commute the life sentence of Ross Ulbricht, the convicted founder of the drug-selling website Silk Road that used crypto for payments.
Ulbricht’s case has energized some crypto advocates and Libertarian activists, who believe government investigators overreached in building their case against Silk Road.

 President Donald Trump this week signed an executive order to establish U.S. dominance in the digital asset market and make the country the global center of crypto. But does that order deliver on what Trump said he'd accomplish?

 One of Trump's promises to the crypto industry was the establishment of a ""strategic national bitcoin stockpile."" While the crypto industry is generally excited about the order providing legal protections for crypto users and the promise of greater regulatory clarity, some are worried about a perceived pivot from the definite establishment of a national bitcoin stockpile.

 Bitcoin (BTCUSD) sold off slightly following the announcement Thursday, though it recovered and was trading close to $105,000 in late-Friday trading.

 The executive order established a working group to offer regulatory clarity on a number of issues, including ""potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile.""

 This phrasing creates some confusion. Firstly, the executive order simply discusses the exploration of a ""potential"" stockpile. Secondly, the language in the executive order is not specific to bitcoin and instead refers to a stockpile of ""digital assets.""

 It also mentions the possibility of this stockpile being derived from the government's existing crypto holdings that it has accumulated from various enforcement actions instead of trading cryptocurrencies like the government does for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

 ""'Stockpile' is jargon that means holding what they have, but not necessarily buying anything,"" Galaxy Digital Head of Research Alex Thorn posted on X. According to data shared by Thorn in his X post, the stockpile would largely be made up of bitcoin rather than alternative digital assets.

 Others are worried that the path to creating a bitcoin stockpile may not be entirely hurdle-free.

 ""As I've been saying, we will need legislation for a 'true' [strategic bitcoin reserve], and that won't pass,"" posted Castle Island Ventures Partner Nic Carter.

 Despite the executive order, the odds of a bitcoin strategic reserve happening in the U.S. this year dropped from a peak of 76% to 61% over the past day, according to prediction market Polymarket.

 That said, there is plenty more for the crypto industry to cheer about in the executive order.

 ""The President's EO today is mostly about setting up the right processes and teams to improve crypto policy,"" Coin Center Executive Director Peter Van Valkenburgh posted on X Thursday.

 The crypto industry has often criticized the lack of clarity on regulations as well as the enforcement-driven approach by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Some of their grievances may have already begun to get redressed.

 For example, after the executive order was signed the SEC rescinded a contentious crypto accounting rule called Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121) that effectively made it impractical for traditional banks to act as custodians for bitcoin.

 ""SAB 121 was disastrous for the banking industry, and only stunted American innovation and advancement of digital assets,"" U.S Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Republican from Wyoming, posted on X.

 Major U.S. stock indexes closed lower Monday, though up substantially from early-session lows following news that U.S. tariffs on imports from Mexico would be delayed by a month.

 The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.8% and 1.2%, respectively, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.3%. Stocks were coming off a volatile week of trading fueled by corporate results, the Federal Reserve's latest decision on interest rates, the revelation that Chinese startup DeepSeek had launched a highly effective, low-cost AI model and uncertainty about trade policy.

 Stocks fell sharply early Monday after President Donald Trump over the weekend signed executive orders calling for 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and 10% tariffs on China, all of which were due to go into effect early Tuesday. News of the pause in the tariff order on Mexico helped stocks recover, and soon after the close of trading the U.S. reached a similar agreement with Canada to postponse implementation by 30 days.

 Investors are concerned that tariffs could have a damaging effect on various U.S. industries, while also spurring inflation that could keep the Fed from cutting interest rates this year.

 ""In the weeks ahead, tariffs are likely to represent an overhang on markets and contribute to volatility, at least until investors gain greater clarity on the path and destination of US trade policy,"" UBS Global Wealth Management Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele said before news of the postponed implementation of tariffs.

 Shares of automakers were among those that took a hit on Monday amid concerns about the potential impact of tariffs. General Motors (GM) and Toyota Motors (TM) both fell about 3%, while Stellantis (STLA) slid nearly 4%.

 Electric vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA) shed 5.2% leading a broader downturn for mega-cap tech stocks. AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) fell 2.8% and 3.4%, respectively, while Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Broadcom (AVGO) also lost ground. Meta Platforms (META) gained 1.2%.

 Palantir (PLTR) shares gained 1.5% ahead of the release after the closing bell of the analytics software provider's quarterly results. Shares soared more than 20% in after-hours trading following a better-than-expected earnings report.

 Bitcoin, which had fallen as low as $91,000 on Sunday as investors responded to the tariff news by selling riskier assets, jumped to $101,500 in recent trading.

 The yield on 10-year Treasurys, which is sensitive to investor views on the economic outlook, was at 4.55% late Monday, down from Friday's close of 4.57% but up from an intraday low of 4.46%.

 Gold futures were up 0.6% at around $2,850, near a new record high, while WTI crude oil futures rose 0.3%.

What Analysts Think of Alphabet Ahead of Earnings Tuesday
 Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is slated to report its fourth-quarter results after the market closes Tuesday, with analysts mostly bullish on the tech giant's stock.

 Of the 19 analysts covering the stock tracked by Visible Alpha, 15 have issued “buy” or equivalent ratings, with four “hold” ratings. Their consensus price target is about $219.

 Alphabet shares fell 1.4% to close Monday at around $201. The stock has gained 41% over the past 12 months, handily outpacing the S&P 500's gains over the period.

TradingView
 Alphabet is expected to report fourth-quarter revenue of $96.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year, and earnings of $26.19 billion, or $2.12 per share, up from $20.69 billion, or $1.64 per share, a year earlier. 

 Jefferies recently maintained a “buy” rating and $235 price target for the stock, writing that Alphabet’s “fundamentals appear to be improving with solid ad spend,” and that the company is seeing growing demand for Google Cloud.

 The tech giant's spending on AI will also likely be in focus after the emergence of a sophisticated, cost-efficient AI model from Chinese startup DeepSeek  raised concerns about the competitiveness of U.S. firms and their spending on the emerging tech.

 Bank of America analysts told clients in a note Friday that they view last week's strong results from Meta (META), which stood by its AI spending plans, as a positive signal for Alphabet.

 Earlier in the week, Raymond James and Bank of America analysts also suggested that DeepSeek’s rapid rise could push the tech giant to act with greater urgency on AI developments.

Palantir Pops on Strong Outlook Amid AI Boom
 Palantir's (PLTR) fourth-quarter revenue and outlook for 2025 topped analysts' expectations, news that sent shares soaring in extended trading Monday.

 The analytics software provider’s revenue grew 36% year-over-year to $828 million, surpassing the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha on strong demand for the company's Artificial Intelligence Platform.

 Earnings came in at $79.01 million, or 3 cents per share, down from $93.39 million, or 4 cents per share, a year earlier, and below expectations, thanks in part to one-time expenses related to stock appreciation rights. However, earnings after adjustment jumped 80% to $341.95 million, or 14 cents per share, topping the analyst consensus.

 ""Our business results continue to astound, demonstrating our deepening position at the center of the AI revolution,"" said Palantir CEO Alex Karp in a release.

 Palantir said it anticipates 2025 revenue of $3.74 billion to $3.76 billion, above the analyst consensus of $3.51 billion. 

 Shares of Palantir surged more than 20% in extended trading Monday following the release. The stock closed at a record high of $83.74 Monday and has quintupled in value over the past 12 months

Why Tesla Tumbled After Trump Tariffs
 Tesla (TSLA) was the worst-performing Magnificent Seven stock on Monday, falling more than 5%, after President Trump moved to impose stiff tariffs on America's largest trading partners.

 The automotive industries of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, are deeply intertwined; Tesla vehicles, despite being assembled in the U.S., contain parts from Canada and Mexico.

 Some Canadian officials have proposed directing retaliation at President Trump and his allies, including Tesla's CEO Elon Musk and Republican-led states.

Nvidia Levels to Watch as Stock Continues to Slump
 Nvidia (NVDA) shares fell again Monday, adding to the stock's steep losses last week that were fueled by concerns related to Chinese startup DeepSeek's low-cost AI model.

 The losses on Monday came as the Trump administration said it would impose tariffs on leading trading partners, which has prompted concerns of a broader global trade war that could see countries introduce counter measures on items, including American AI chips.

 Nvidia shares were down 2% at around $118 in late trading Monday, after falling 16% last week following the revelation of DeepSeek's success, which sparked worries that Big Tech’s investment in the chipmaker's pricey AI offerings could wane. Nvidia shares have lost nearly a quarter of their value since hitting a record high in early January but are still up about 80% over the past 12 months.

 Nvidia shares broke down below a seven-month rising wedge pattern last week on the highest trading volume since August 2023, suggesting institutional  selling participation.

 Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) fell below the 50 threshold to its lowest level since December 2022, confirming increasing selling momentum.

 Investors should watch key support levels on Nvidia's chart around $96, $76, and $50, while also monitoring important resistance levels near $130 and $150.

Manufacturing Expansion Threatened by Higher Tariffs
 The manufacturing sector had its best month in more than two years in January. However, the improvement was not enough to soothe economists' worries about the effects of President Donald Trump’s trade policies on the manufacturing industry.

 The Institute of Supply Management manufacturing sector Purchasing Managers’ Index for January moved above the 50% line for the first time in 26 months, indicating economic expansion in the sector.

  The 50.9% reading comes in higher than last month’s 49.2% result and is slightly more than predictions from economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires.

 But the results don’t factor in Trump’s move to levy tariffs on Canada and China beginning Tuesday and tariffs on Mexico next month. The three countries represent about 40% of U.S. imports. 

 “The manufacturing sector continued its positive momentum in January, but we expect this will be short-lived due to the trade war initiated by President Trump over the weekend,” said Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “Our initial modeling suggests markedly lower demand for goods, higher inflation, and higher interest rates—all of which will weigh on the nascent upturn in manufacturing.”

Goldman Analysts Say Tariffs Could be 5% Blow to S&P 500
 Goldman Sachs analysts modeled out how the tariffs could impact U.S. markets, and estimated the levies may reduce the S&P 500’s fair value by roughly 5%.

 Tariffs, they explained, will either shrink U.S. profit margins by raising input costs or, if higher costs are passed on to consumers, slow sales. “We estimate that every 5pp increase in the US tariff rate would reduce S&P 500 EPS by roughly 1-2%. As a result, if sustained, the tariffs announced this weekend would reduce our S&P 500 EPS forecasts by roughly 2-3%,” the analysts wrote in a note Sunday. 

 In addition, tariffs are expected to support U.S. dollar strength. International sales account for about 28% of the S&P 500’s revenue, and a stronger dollar eats into the value of those sales. Though, the analysts note, the dollar's impact on earnings may be limited given Canada and Mexico account for less than 2% of the S&P 500’s sales. 

 The tariffs have amplified economic and political uncertainty, threatening to undercut Wall Street’s appetite for risk. According to Goldman, the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index on Friday jumped to 502, its highest level since March 2020. Historically, this level of uncertainty has translated to a 3% reduction in the S&P 500’s forward P/E ratio. 

 Since tariffs could both stoke inflation and weigh on economic growth, their impact on Treasury yields, especially on the long-term bonds that have the biggest effect on stocks, is expected to be minimal.

What Wall Street Thinks of Palantir Ahead of Earnings Monday
 Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is set to report fourth-quarter results after the market closes Monday, with analysts largely skeptical on whether the analytics software provider's stock can sustain its recent momentum.

 None of the 13 analysts covering the stock tracked by Visible Alpha expect the stock has further to rise, with their consensus price target of $50 is about 40% below its current level.

 The stock was down 0.5% at around $82 in midday trading Monday. Palantir shares have gained nearly 400% over the past 12 months as demand surged for the company's AI products.

TradingView
 Wedbush analysts, who are more bullish on the stock than others polled by Visible Alpha, recently raised their price target to $90 from $75, and said they believe Palantir “has a path to become the next Oracle or Salesforce over the coming years,” adding they believe Wall Street is underestimating the revenue potential of Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform.

 However, others like Jefferies, which on Thursday maintained an “underperform” rating and price target of $28, have suggested the stock is trading at such a high premium that ""any signs of decelerating growth could cause concern.""

 Palantir is expected to report fourth-quarter revenue of nearly $775 million, up 27% year-over-year, and earnings of $83.51 million, or 3 cents per share, down from $96.91 million, or 4 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings after adjustment are expected to rise 35% to $273.79 million, or 11 cents per share.

 In the third quarter, Palantir reported better-than-expected results and raised its revenue guidance for the last quarter of the year.

Stocks to Watch in February
 Stocks rose in January, boosted by encouraging inflation data, optimism about President Donald Trump's pro-business agenda, and the announcement of a major AI infrastructure investment.

 But the month wasn't without its road bumps. The Trump administration roiled markets on the last day of the month with his plan to move forward with tariffs against China, Canada, and Mexico, three of America's largest trading partners. Plus, tech investors were caught off guard by the release of a surprisingly efficient Chinese AI model that raised questions about the competitiveness of American models and the wisdom of Silicon Valley's massive spending.

 Among the stocks that investors should keep a close eye on this month: Nvidia (NVDA), Palantir (PLTR), AppLovin (APP), Allstate (ALL) and oil majors ExxonMobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX).

Constellation Brands Sinks as Tariffs May Hit Beer Sales
 Among the companies feeling the impact of the tariffs announced over the weekend is alcoholic beverage giant Constellation Brands (STZ).

 Shares of the firm that imports Modelo and Corona beers from Mexico were down nearly about 2% in recent trading after falling as much as 8% earlier in the session.

 The potential impact of the sanctions led Piper Sandler to downgrade the stock to ""neutral"" from ""overweight,"" and slash the price target to $200 from $245, according to reports.

 Sales of Mexican beer have been a big driver of Constellation Brands' recent results. Its Modelo Especial overtook Anheuser-Busch InBev's (BUD) Bud Light as the U.S.'s best-selling beer in 2023.

 Last month, Constellation Brands reported a 3% year-over-year rise in beer sales in its fiscal 2025 third-quarter results, but wine and spirits revenue slumped 14%. It also lowered its full-year outlook, warning that it sees more ""normalized spending"" by consumers in the future.

TradingView
 Constellation Brands shares sank to their lowest level in more than four years this morning.

Bitcoin Levels to Watch as Price Drops on Tariff News
 Bitcoin (BTCUSD) has tumbled over concerns about the potential impacts of U.S. tariffs imposed on products coming from Canada, Mexico and China.

 The cryptocurrency's price has carved out two peaks around the same level between December and January, potentially forming a double top, a classic chart pattern that signals a downside reversal.

 Investors should monitor crucial support levels on bitcoin's chart around $92,000, $87,000, and $74,000, while also monitoring a key overhead area near $106,000.

 Bitcoin was trading around $96,000 recently, down from last week's highs of around $106,000.

MicroStrategy, the largest corporate bitcoin holder, paused its bitcoin buying spree after 12 consecutive weeks of accumulation. The mega stockpiler’s halt coincides with a brutal few days for bitcoin, which saw its price seesaw in sync with the market and the overall crypto ecosystem. The Fed’s pausing of rate cuts, coupled with President Trump’s on-and-off-again threats of tariffs and China’s retaliatory 15% tariff, threw a wrench in global markets.
Last week, MicroStrategy did not sell any shares of class A common stock under its at-the-market equity offering program, and did not purchase any bitcoin. As of 2/2/2025, we hodl 471,107 $BTC acquired for ~$30.4 billion at ~$64,511 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/QTBWl8KlNv
MicroStrategy’s last purchase was on January 27, bringing its total holdings to 471,107 bitcoin. Last week, it also announced the pricing of its Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock “at a public offering price of $80.00 per share,” according to a statement. The offering raised $563.4 million — up from the initial $250 million target — and intends to use the proceeds “for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital.”
“The issuance and sale of the perpetual strike preferred stock are scheduled to settle on February 5, 2025, subject to customary closing conditions,” the statement read, which is also the date of the company’s next earnings release.
Many are trying to read the tea leaves in the surprising pause, with some bears arguing that this might be a harbinger of bad news for bitcoin.
JUST IN: MicroStrategy did not buy any #Bitcoin last week, ending a streak of 12 consecutive weeks of buying. You know the bubble is about to pop when even the biggest bulls halt their purchases .
Yet others also noted that, given the company’s huge stash, it’s hard to negate its commitment to bitcoin. 
“With a ~$45 billion position in bitcoin, I don’t think anyone is questioning Michael Saylor’s conviction regarding the investment,” Autonomys CEO Todd Ruoff said.
That’s why some experts say the pause is more likely due to other factors and strategic plans. 
First, MicroStrategy, which joined the Nasdaq in December, has earnings tomorrow, which could place pre-earnings restrictions for a period to remain compliant with the SEC, Two Prime CEO Alexander Blume said.
In addition, the recent $563 million raise also underscores Saylor’s hodling conviction.
“Bonds are a capital-efficient way to raise capital and signals strength to fund future bitcoin investments,” Kevin Rusher, founder of tokenization platform RAAC, said. “The buying pause is unlikely to be driven by market sentiment — it will just be part of MicroStrategy’s long-term plan.”

Kaiko Research puts the odds of an XRP ETF being first to hit the US market higher than solana and dogecoin efforts.
The coins are worth about $320 million at current prices.
Canada was also the first to list a spot bitcoin ETF.
As usual, not long after CEO Michael Saylor hinted that Strategy would buy more bitcoin, it announced it acquired 3,459 bitcoin at roughly $82,618 for a total cost of $285.8 million. Bitcoin was up this morning, hovering just below $85,000. Shares of Strategy also rose in early trading.
The bitcoin holding company now has 531,644 bitcoin in its reserve, far more than any other corporation or even the US government. This is the first time the company has purchased the asset since March 31, as well as the first time since it said it would incur a $5.9 billion unrealized loss on its digital assets in the first quarter.
Strategy has never sold a single bitcoin since it starting accumulating it in August 2020. Saylor has been pretty vocal about the fact that none of the chaos caused by the tariffs’ ever-evolving situation is bothering him, even adding that “Bitcoin is powered by Chaos.” 
Tariffs turmoil and extremely volatile markets also didn’t deter Metaplanet from buying bitcoin. The Japanese company, which is emulating Saylor’s strategy, bought 319 bitcoin. As of today, it now holds 4,525 bitcoin in its reserve.
Much has been said about bitcoin “decoupling” from risk assets amid the tariff war that’s wreaking havoc on markets globally, with Grayscale going so far as to say tariffs and inflation could be positive for bitcoin. 
This week bitcoin felt very coupled, as it continued to seesaw amid global economic uncertainty, dropping to $75,000 on Tuesday and then soaring to $82,000 following President Trump’s announcement of a 90-day pause on most tariffs. Then it dropped with the rest of the market yesterday. This morning, it’s back to hovering around $82,000, basically where it was last Friday.
Companies with bitcoin corporate reserves, which have been on a buying spree in the past few months, largely took a breather. 
Strategy, the largest corporate holder at 528,285 bitcoin, has not made any purchases since March 31, despite the dip.
The company released a regulatory filing on April 7, which triggered an avalanche of rumors about whether it would be forced to sell its bitcoin.
“As bitcoin constitutes the vast bulk of assets on our balance sheet, if we are unable to secure equity or debt financing in a timely manner, on favorable terms, or at all, we may be required to sell bitcoin to satisfy our financial obligations,” the filing said.
Strategy has never sold a single bitcoin since it started buying it in 2020. Cofounder Michael Saylor, at least on social media, remains unbothered by outside factors, tariffs or otherwise.
“Bitcoin is powered by Chaos,” he posted on X, as well as, “Bitcoin is the Best Idea. There is no Second Best.” 
Companies that did update their bitcoin holdings include CleanSpark, which produced 706 bitcoin in March and now holds 11,869 in its reserve. Mining company Bitfufu also increased its bitcoin holdings, adding 47 bitcoin in the month to bring its total to 1,847.

The largest cryptocurrency rose above $100,000 for the first time since Feb. 4, according to CCData, after the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the economy added 143,000 jobs in January, below the forecast 170,000 and down from 256,000 in December.
Still, the unemployment rate dropped to 4%, compared with an expected 4.1% and December’s 4.1% and growth in average hourly earnings blew past estimates coming in at 0.5% compared with the expected at 0.3%.""Relatively high wage inflation and a low unemployment rate mean that the Federal Reserve isn't likely to cut rates anytime soon, but markets already know that,"" said Zach Pandl, Grayscale’s head of research. ""As long as equity markets remain broadly stable, Bitcoin could make news highs later this quarter"".
The chance of the Federal Reserve lowering the benchmark interest rate at its March meeting fell to 8% from 15% after the report, according to CME FedWatch data.
The Fed cut the fed funds rate by 100 basis points over the last four months of 2024, and several weeks ago investors were expecting more of the same in 2025. A string of strong economic and inflation data since, however, has had the Fed quickly backtracking on its dovishness and traders pricing out the odds of any further policy ease.

Bitcoin (BTC) price recovers slightly and trades around $97,800 on Monday after reaching a low of $91,231 last week. CryptoQuant data shows 14,000 long-dormant BTC moved on Monday, and BTC Exchange Netflow reached FTX collapse levels. Moreover, Nick Forster, founder of Derive.xyz, told FXStreet that the chances of BTC reaching $200K by December 26, 2025 had risen slightly to 12%, up from 11% last week.
Bitcoin price recovers slightly, trading around $97,800 during the early European trading session on Monday, after correcting for two consecutive weeks. CryptoQuant data shows that on Monday, 14,000 BTC that had been inactive for 7 to 10 years were moved. 
Despite the large volume, these coins have not yet been transferred to any exchanges, suggesting they are not intended for immediate sale. However, traders should remain cautious as the average acquisition price of these coins is low, which could influence the holders’ future decisions regarding potential sales.

The previous week, CryptoQuant data showed the largest BTC net outflow since 2022.
The graph below shows that Bitcoin Exchange Netflow has returned to levels last seen during the FTX collapse, accompanied by a 3% decline in BTC supply on exchanges. 
Notably, the second-largest outflow in this period occurred last July, nearly matching this week’s magnitude. Despite the prevailing sentiment, major buyers — possibly institutional investors or funds — accumulate during price dips.

QCP Capital’s report on Monday states, “Following DeepSeek’s move two weeks ago and last week’s tariff-driven volatility. This time, Trump’s announcement of a 25% levy on steel and aluminum briefly unsettled markets ahead of Powell’s testimony and CPI data.”
The report further explained that with Mexico and Canada among the top three US suppliers, the tariffs cast doubt on last week’s temporary delay and could reignite trade tensions. Adding to the uncertainty, Trump’s remarks on potential sanctions against Japan — a key US ally — follow the White House’s move to block Nippon Steel’s takeover of US Steel. Moreover, BTC volatility now skews in favor of puts until April, reflecting a lack of upside catalysts.
However, in an exclusive interview with FXStreet, Nick Forster, Founder of Derive.xyz, said “For BTC, the chances of it reaching $200K by December 26, 2025 have risen slightly to 12%, up from 11% last week.”
Forster continued that there’s a 15% chance of BTC exceeding $135K by the end of Q2, up from 14%.
Bitcoin price faced rejection, closed below the $100,000 psychological level and declined nearly 2% in the previous week. At the time of writing on Monday, it recovers slightly and trades at around $97,800.
If BTC continues its correction, it could extend the decline to test its psychologically important level of $90,000.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 45 after being rejected from its neutral level of 50 last week, indicating slightly bearish momentum. Moreover, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed a bearish crossover, hinting at further correction ahead.

However, if BTC recovers and finds support around $100,000, it would extend the recovery to retest its January 31 high of $106,012.
Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.
Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.
Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

But despite facing numerous setbacks, he is determined to continue on his mission to retrieve it.
""This is my job, if you will. My 9 to 5,"" he said, adding he would ""absolutely not"" give up.
The value of the cryptocurrency has dramatically increased in recent months, and with the hard drive currently worth about £620m, Mr Howells said ""it makes sense for me to focus my energy on this"" - although he does do some other work with crypto currencies. 
Mr Howells, from Newport, claimed his ex-partner mistakenly threw out the hard drive, containing 8,000 bitcoins, in 2013, with it ending up in a tip owned by Newport City Council. 
Last month, a High Court judge threw out his efforts to access the landfill or get £495m in compensation, saying there were no ""reasonable grounds"" for bringing the claim and ""no realistic prospect"" of succeeding at a full trial.
He is now planning a case – representing himself using artificial intelligence to support his claim – at the Court of Appeal. He has also expressed interested in buying the site after the council said it planned to close it in the 2025-26 financial year. 
Newport council said it was making no further comment on the matter.
Mr Howells was an early adopter of cryptocurrencies, mining the Bitcoin in 2009 when it was a small fraction of its current value.
He has said that his former partner accidentally dumped the hard drive – about the size of a mobile phone – containing a Bitcoin wallet in 2013. As its value soared, he organised a team of experts to attempt to locate and recover it.
He repeatedly asked permission from the council for access to the site, offering it a share of the missing Bitcoin if it was successfully recovered.
After Mr Howells launched legal proceedings, the council applied for a High Court hearing to ask a judge to dismiss the claim before going to trial – which the judge did last month.
The council argued its environmental permits would forbid any attempt to excavate the site for the search and previously said such work ""would have a huge negative environmental impact on the surrounding area"".
Unwilling to give up, Mr Howells now believes he has two options open to him to retrieve the digital wallet – launch a case at the Court of Appeal, or work with investors to try to buy the landfill site from the council, after it announced the site is ""coming to the end of its life"" and it plans to close it within the next two years.
Mr Howells told BBC News he was pleased with the work his legal team had done in the High Court trial, but that he would now be representing himself in a case filed with the Court of Appeal – using an ""artificial intelligence agent"" to assist his claim.
He described AI as ""an absolutely amazing technology"" that had helped him better understand court processes and the law, and that he believed he had about seven ""solid grounds in law"" for his case, which he hopes to be able to present in-person to the Court of Appeal.
One of the arguments in his case will centre on the council's plans to close the site, something he argued should have been revealed during the High Court trial.
""That is material information that should have been made [at the trial] – the judge should have been aware of that, as well as myself,"" he said.
Mr Howells also said buying and fully excavating the site would save the council what he argued were significant maintenance costs once the site closes.
""Every single piece would be extracted or recycled, and at the end of the process we would have a hard drive in our hands - and we would also have an empty landfill,"" he said.
In the High Court trial, the council also argued that the hard drive became its property as soon as it entered the landfill site, but Mr Howells said this failed to take into account the fact it was his ex-partner who threw it out.
""It was taken without my permission or consent,"" he said.
Mr Howells said he was also exploring the option of buying the site from the council, adding he had ""preliminary agreements"" with investors – including those in the Middle East and the United States – who could make funding available if he had permission to buy the site.
""They're not just going to put millions of quid in my back pocket... but if the council show a willingness to sell the site, then the funding will be available,"" he said.
The council has made no indication it is interested in selling the site and, as part of its closure, has secured planning permission for a solar farm on part of the land.
Having spent many years pursuing it, including opening legal cases, Mr Howells said he was certain the hard drive remained on the landfill, which holds more than 1.4 million tonnes of waste.
He said he had done his ""due diligence and research"", having spoken to a site manager at the landfill.
""Anything that was put into that site is still there. So, where else could it be?""
Asked if he would ever give up his mission to retrieve it, he said: ""Absolutely not. This is like the final battle in Braveheart.""
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a virtual or digital currency that has no physical form.
Bitcoins can be split into smaller units, with a satoshi being the smallest monetary unit. 
Satoshis are named after Bitcoin's inventor Satoshi Nakamoto – believed to be a pseudonym – who wrote a key document about the currency in 2008.
Those investing in the product around this time, like Mr Howells, were part of a ""very small"" crypto community known as Cypherpunks, said Billy Bambrough, author of the CryptoCodex newsletter.
Bitcoin was not the first cryptocurrency to be invented, but it did gain considerable attention with early adherents being ""very quickly enamoured with it"", Mr Bambrough said.
Prices began to rise in about 2016 and 2017, and again in 2020 during the Covid pandemic when ""stock markets, cryptocurrencies and meme coins went up hugely"".
""A lot of people got very rich, but a lot of people also lost money,"" Mr Bambrough said.
The cryptocurrency also saw rapid increases in late 2024, shortly after Donald Trump's victory in the US general election, with his administration being seen as far friendlier towards cryptocurrencies than the Biden White House.
""A lot of people in the crypto and Bitcoin worlds say the price has gone up so much in such a short amount of time, they claim it could go higher and higher,"" Mr Bambrough said.
""So I can understand why James [Howells] is keen to find his Bitcoin.""

 Bitcoin (BTCUSD) fell below $87,000 Tuesday—a sharp drop from the $95,000 level at which it was trading two days ago and the $100,000 mark it tested late last week—as fears about economic uncertainty deepened the sell-off in the cryptocurrency markets.

 Bitcoin now down about 20% since hitting an all-time high of $109,000 last month just prior to U.S. President Donald Trump's inauguration.

 After remaining range-bound in recent weeks, bitcoin's sudden drop may be attributed to increasing worries about U.S. economic factors, especially inflation and trade policies.

 In a press conference Monday, Trump reiterated that tariffs on Mexico and Canada will go ahead as planned. Economists have long feared that imposition of tariffs could reignite inflation. Crypto investors will also be watching Friday's inflation data—known as core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation metric—for clues after the January Consumer Price Index (CPI) came in hotter than expected.

 Persistent inflation would make it harder for the Fed to aggressively cut interest rates, which isn't great for investors in risky assets such as crypto or stocks. Higher rates imply higher yields on less-risky Treasurys, and that prospect has shaken equity and crypto markets alike.

 Is this sudden drop an opportunity for investors to scoop up bitcoin for a more favorable price? Not really, according to Standard Chartered Global Head of Digital Assets Research Geoff Kendrick.

 ""DO NOT buy the dip yet, a move to the low $80s is on,"" Kendrick wrote in a research note that Coindesk reported Tuesday, adding that, ""Before buying the dip is attractive I think we get a $1B [exchange-traded fund] outflow day.""

 Investors pulled out money from spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Monday, with net outflows recorded at $539 million, according to data from Farside Investors. That's the second-highest outflow day reported in 2025 and the fifth-largest outflow since these ETFs began trading in January last year.

 Kendrick and digital asset manager Bitwise had previously predicted bitcoin would soar to more than $200,000 in 2025.

 Non-bitcoin crypto assets have suffered to an even greater extent than bitcoin since Inauguration Day. For example, Solana (SOLUSD), which is where much of the memecoin phenomenon has occurred this cycle, has had its price cut nearly in half since Trump came into office. Recent controversies in the memecoin market have led some market observers to claim this crypto fad is now coming to an end.

 ""What crypto is digesting right now is the end of the memecoin boom,"" Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan posted on X Tuesday, adding that the hype around tokens like Melania and Libra will ""kill"" the memecoin craze within six months.

 Over the past 24 hours, the Libra token is down roughly 20%, the Melania token has lost 23%, and the Trump token has dropped by 11%, according to Coinmarketcap.

The market prices of the five coins he named - Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano - all swiftly jumped after the announcement.
During Trump's presidential campaign, he aggressively courted the crypto community. The previous US president, Joe Biden, had overseen a crackdown on crypto due to concerns about fraud and money laundering.
It is unclear how the new stockpile will work. More information is expected on Friday, when Trump plans to host the first Crypto Summit at the White House.
In a social media post on Sunday, Trump said he had signed an order which ""directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA"".
About an hour later he added in another post: ""And, obviously, BTC and ETH, as other valuable Cryptocurrencies, will be at the heart of the Reserve.""
The first three coins he named jumped by up to 62% on Sunday.
Bitcoin and Ethereum also jumped by more than 10% each.
The posts marked a new upward turn for crypto prices, which had dropped sharply since spiking after his election. 
Shortly after taking office in January, Trump signed an executive to create a presidential working group tasked with proposing new crypto laws and regulations.
The order called on the group to ""evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile"" that could use ""cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts"".
It is unclear whether creating a new national strategic stockpile would require an act of Congress.
Trump had previously been a crypto critic, telling Fox News in 2021 that Bitcoin is a ""scam"".
But in recent weeks, both he and his wife Melania Trump have launched their own cryptocurrencies, leading to accusations that they are trying to profit from his White House policies.

Monday 3 March 2025 06:34, UK
Cryptocurrency prices have jumped after Donald Trump revealed he would like Bitcoin and other lesser-traded tokens to be in a new US strategic crypto reserve.
He said his January executive order on digital assets would create a stockpile of currencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana and Cardano (ADA).
The names had not previously been announced.
The American president said in a post on Truth Social: ""A US Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA.""
""I will make sure the US is the Crypto Capital of the World.""
""And, obviously, BTC and ETH, as other valuable Cryptocurrencies, will be at the heart of the Reserve,"" he said in a follow-up post. ""I also love Bitcoin and Ethereum!""
Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value, rose over 11% to $94,164 after Sunday's announcement.
Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, was up around 13% at $2,516.
XRP surged 33% while the token tied to Solana jumped 25%. Cardano's coin soared more than 60%.
Bitcoin was trading up around 20% from last week's lows.
The total cryptocurrency market rose about 10%, or more than $300bn (£238bn), in the hours since the announcement, according to cryptocurrency data and analysis company CoinGecko.
This is the first time Mr Trump has specified his support for a crypto ""reserve"" rather than a ""stockpile"". While the former assumes actively buying crypto in regular installments, a stockpile would not sell any of the crypto currently held by the US government.
Mr Trump is hosting the first White House Crypto Summit on Friday, and investors will be watching closely for more clues about the direction of the reserve plans.
His family have also launched their own coins, including his wife Melania.

Mr Trump first introduced the idea of a Bitcoin stockpile, which would ""keep 100% of all the Bitcoin the US government currently holds or acquires into the future"" last summer at major industry conference Bitcoin 2024 in Nashville.
After his re-election to the White House in November, there were more calls for a strategic Bitcoin reserve, helping to send the price of the flagship cryptocurrency to new all-time highs.
Under his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, regulators cracked down on the industry in an attempt to protect Americans from fraud and money laundering.
Under Mr Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission has withdrawn investigations into several crypto companies and dropped a lawsuit against Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the US.
But in recent weeks, crypto prices have fallen sharply, with some of the biggest digital currencies erasing nearly all of the gains made after Mr Trump's election win triggered excitement across the industry.

Bitcoin has surged over the last week as traders bet U.S. president Donald Trump could be pulling back from his threat of global trade tariffs (though fears are swirling over a new, mystery threat).
Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""
The bitcoin price has added around 10% since its early March lows but remains well off its peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin set in January despite a a White House official revealing how Trump could spur the bitcoin price higher.
Now, as a BlackRock executive predicts a “big catalyst” for bitcoin could be on the horizon, traders are braced for meme stock darling GameStop to make a bitcoin-related announcement when it reports fourth-quarter results after Tuesday’s market close—potentially following in the footsteps of Michael Saylor’s Strategy.

U.S. president Donald Trump hosted bitcoin and crypto company executives, including Strategy's ... More Michael Saylor, at a White House bitcoin and crypto summit.
Last month, GameStop received a proposal from Strive Asset Management recommending that the brick-and-mortar video game retailer convert its $5 billion in cash reserves into bitcoin, a move it claims would transform the company into the ""premier bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector.""
Strive Asset Management chief executive Matt Cole told GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen that he “has an incredible opportunity.""
“Letter received,” Cohen then posted to X. Just weeks earlier, Cohen set social media alight when he posted a picture of himself with Michael Saylor, the founder of software company turned acquisition vehicle Strategy.
03/26 update: GameStop has followed through with teased plans to adopt bitcoin, aping Michael Saylor’s Strategy that’s built up the world’s biggest corporate stash of bitcoin—with self-styled “bitcoin historian” Pete Rizzo telling traders to “buckle up.”
While GameStop has $4.75 billion in cash and said it plans to use some of this cash as well as future debt or equity issuances to buy bitcoin, it didn't commit to an amount, somewhat disappointing those who had hoped the company would reveal a firm bitcoin-buy.
GameStop's ""investment policy permits investments in certain cryptocurrency assets, including bitcoin and U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, and if the company acquires bitcoin or U.S. dollar denominated stablecoins, the company will be exposed to certain risks associated with bitcoin or stablecoins, respectively,"" the company's fourth-quarter earnings report read.
GameStop’s stock has climbed almost 20% overnight after the announcement, though it remains well below the sky-high levels it reached in 2021. Meme stock traders, unofficially led by Keith ""Roaring Kitty"" Gill, helped send the stock price of companies, including GameStop and cinema chain AMC, to astronomical levels alongside cryptocurrencies like dogecoin.
Traders are betting GameStop could become the next Strategy, which has seen its stock explode 3,000% since it started buying bitcoin in the summer of 2020.
""Welcome to team bitcoin, Ryan Cohen,"" Saylor posted to X along with the photo of their pair.
That growing team includes Metaplanet and Semler Scientific, both of which have adopted so-called bitcoin treasury strategies.
“Overall, news about crypto initiatives could make GameStop stock even more susceptible to sharp movements,"" analysts at crypto payments platform B2BinPay, said in emailed comments. 
“In the short term, this has already acted as a positive decision, as reflected in the company’s stock growth, however, it also carries risks of volatility. Stablecoins, of course, won’t carry those risks, but bitcoin can go both ways — offering potential for growth but also for a drop. So if the crypto market takes a big hit, it could negatively affect GameStop’s financial standing.”

The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year, recently falling back from its all-time ... More high of almost $110,000 per bitcoin as traders pare back bets on Donald Trump's bitcoin and crypto policy.
Strategy, until recently known as MicroStrategy, now holds around 500,000 bitcoin worth $42 billion after it began aggressively buying bitcoin in 2020.
Saylor was one of a handful of bitcoin and crypto company executives that attended the White House digital asset summit hosted by U.S. president Donald Trump earlier this month.
Last week, Saylor predicted there’s about to be a “Cambrian explosion” of companies and countries buying bitcoin during a Blockworks podcast.

        Share    
As the risk of tariff-related uncertainty persists into the second quarter, the crypto market could face another dip following the recent correction in March, analysts at Nansen say.
As the industry heads into April, Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider crypto market could be staring down another dip as uncertainty surrounding tariffs and U.S. trade policy might cause further volatility.
According to Nansen’s analysts, there’s a chance that the market may face another correction in the weeks after April 2. In fact, the researchers believe there’s a 70% likelihood that another price dip will occur after this date.
President Donald Trump had earlier promised to roll out new tariffs on April 2, calling it a key moment for the economy just weeks after the last round shook up markets and sparked recession worries.
In a recent interview with crypto.news, Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at Nansen, shared her outlook on the market, stating that after a brief correction following April 2, she expects the market to stabilize and pave the way for future growth.
“In my main scenario, 70% subjective likelihood, I expect another leg down in crypto prices after April 2 after we reached a local bottom in mid-March. After this second correction, I expect we will be bottoming for the rest of the year (continuation of the bull market and revisit of the ATHs for BTC).”
Aurelie Barthere
However, it’s not all doom and gloom for the crypto market. While another dip isn’t ruled out, Barthere suggests that after that correction, Bitcoin could rebound, benefiting from a supportive macro environment, including the growing adoption of crypto in the U.S. and a lack of recession signals. Still, Barthere remains cautious as for the remaining 30% “it would be if we have already bottomed or if this is just a dead cat bounce for U.S. equities and crypto,” she said.
“For the remaining 30%: it would be if we have already bottomed or if this is just a dead cat bounce for U.S. equities and crypto (in case of a recession, which is not my base case, I think the U.S. is just slowing from 3% to 1.5-2% growth).”
Aurelie Barthere
The tariff situation has been a significant driver of market volatility, with the U.S. policy uncertainty index reaching new highs. Trade discussions have become a key source of investor anxiety, but Nansen believes that uncertainty could peak soon.
As Treasury Secretary Bessent recently noted, many of the U.S. trading partners are already negotiating to lower their own trade barriers, which has helped to calm some fears. Even Trump recently hinted at potential tariff “exemptions” in certain circumstances. But as Barthere pointed out, while these talks may result in long-term growth benefits for the U.S., the lingering uncertainty may last well into Q2.
“Right now, I think that we are experiencing corrections within a crypto bull market. Why I see this as a bull market still: 1) Ongoing progress on crypto regulation and crypto institutionalization in the U.S., and 2) U.S. real growth has slowed but is not flashing ‘recession.’ Of course, this is my only main scenario, and I will continue to watch data and markets for signs that this is the correct reading.”
Aurelie Barthere
As Barthere put it, there’s a “50/50 chance that we’ve passed the peak of trade policy uncertainty,” adding that the true impact of these tariff negotiations might not be fully clear until mid-year. “We still see this peak uncertainty as more likely between April and June, especially with the start of U.S. tax cut package discussions,” she wrote in the research report.
The uncertainty, according to Nansen’s research, could trigger another short-term correction in both Bitcoin and U.S. equities.
Still, there’s reason for optimism. The report mentions that technicals are showing encouraging signs. “The dip is being bought, for BTC and for U.S. equities,” Barthere says, adding that spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a “seven-day streak of net inflows, a first since crypto prices peaked.”
One way or the other, it’s clear that the market remains cautious. A lot of people are questioning whether the crypto bull run is still going strong or if we’re getting close to a peak. If history is any indication, times of economic uncertainty have often lined up with market downturns, making investors even more cautious.
After market sentiment hit extreme fear last week, with some investment banks raising the U.S. recession probability to 40% this year, hard economic data has eased these concerns. The latest U.S. March flash PMI report shows a 53.5 score, the highest in three months, suggesting a 1.9% annual growth rate. However, the growth for the whole quarter is lower at 1.5% due to weaker data in January and February.
Barthere emphasized that so far, there’s no hard evidence of a recession as “most of the data weakness has been in sentiment indicators, while hard economic data has held up.” She added that “there is no evidence of recession at this stage, so no evidence that we have transitioned to a bear market.”
While the coming months may bring more ups and downs, Nansen’s report suggests that the overall bull market is still in play. As Barthere puts it, the market is “likely to see a correction, but then we’ll bottom out for the rest of the year and head towards new highs.”

Bitcoin (BTC), hovering just below $88,000 a day ago, tumbled to $83,800 recently and is down 3.8% over the past 24 hours. The broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index declined 5.7%, with native cryptos Avalanche (AVAX), Polygon (POL), Near (NEAR), and Uniswap (UNI) all nursing almost 10% losses during the same period. Today's sell-off wiped out $115 billion of the total market value of cryptocurrencies, TradingView data shows.


Ethereum's ether (ETH) declined over 6% to extend its downtrend against BTC, falling to its weakest relative price to the largest cryptocurrency since May 2020. Underscoring the bearish trend, spot ETH exchange-traded funds failed to attract any net inflows since early March, while their BTC counterparts saw over $1 billion of inflows in the past two weeks, according to Farside Investors data.

The ugly crypto price action coincided with U.S. stocks selling off during the day on poor economic data, with the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index down 2% and 2.8%, respectively. Crypto-focused stocks also suffered heavy losses: Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate BTC holder, closed the day 10% lower, while crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) dropped 7.7%.

The February PCE inflation report, released this morning, showed a 2.5% year-over-year increase in the price index, with core inflation at 2.8%, slightly above expectations. Consumer spending showed a modest 0.4% rise, though inflation-adjusted figures indicate minimal growth, suggesting potential headwinds for economic growth. The Federal Reserve of Atlanta's GDPNow model now projects the U.S. economy to contract 2.8% in the first quarter, 0.5% adjusted for gold imports and exports, spurring stagflationary fears.

The implementation of broad-scale U.S. tariffs next week—the so-called ""Liberation Day' on April 2, as the Trump administration refers to—also compounded investor concerns across markets.

Bitcoin has closely correlated with the Nasdaq lately, so U.S. equities rolling over for another leg down could weigh on the broader crypto market. However, on a more optimistic note, today's decline could be BTC filling the price gap at around $84,000-$85,000 between Monday's open and the previous week's close on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures market. Historically, BTC usually revisited similar CME gaps and a drop to $84,000 was in the cards, CoinDesk senior analyst James Van Straten noted earlier this week.

""At this stage it’s difficult to determine if we have already seen a bottom in 2025,"" Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, said in a market note. Despite the on-going correction, he noted several positive trends such as crypto-friendly policies in the U.S. and more traditional financial firms entering the industry or expanding crypto offerings, which could bode well for digital assets later in the year.

""Any additional setbacks that we might see should be exceptionally well supported into the $70-75k area,"" he added.

The price rejection occurred at the cusp of the descending trendline (black) and the upper range of the ascending channel pattern.
On the daily chart, BTC is currently below the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) again, and a potential close below the key indicator might trigger further downside.
Global liquidity expansion could help Bitcoin price 
Recent analysis from macroeconomic market analyst Capital Flows pointed out that Bitcoin could correct to the $72,000-$75,000 region if liquidity conditions remain unchanged. 
Macro liquidity refers to the total capital available in the financial system that can easily flow into risk-on assets like equities and crypto but is influenced by factors like interest rates, US Federal Reserve policies and market conditions.
According to Capital Flows, Bitcoin is exhibiting a “greater convergence” with traditional risk assets, but it remains at the periphery of the risk curve. This implies that for capital to flow back into BTC, investors’ mindset must shift from focusing on less risky assets, such as bonds, to riskier assets like BTC or low-quality banks in the Russell index. The researcher said, 
On the contrary, other analysts have pointed out that the rise of the Global M2 money supply could potentially trigger a BTC rally. The Global Liquidity chart, which monitors M2 growth from major central banks, has historically formed a correlation with Bitcoin's price movements. 
Colin Talks Crypto, a crypto commentator, said that the predictive correlation between M2 supply and BTC indicates a BTC rally around May 1, which might last two months.
However, the key difference between macro liquidity and global M2 growth is that while M2 measures total money supply, macro liquidity highlights the ease at which capital can flow into risk assets. For context, even if the M2 money supply rises, macro liquidity might remain the same if the money is allocated to low-risk assets. In light of that, Capital Flows said,

Bitcoin fills sub-$85K CME gap
Bitcoin’s recent rally created a CME gap between $84,435 and $85,000. The CME Bitcoin futures gap indicates the difference between the closing price of BTC CME futures on Friday and the opening price on Sunday evening. The gaps get filled most of the time, and traders approach these levels from the point of resistance or support, depending on the market structure. 
As illustrated in the chart, BTC price filled the CME gap before its daily close on March 28, which can lead to a short-term bounce. The CME gap is also aligned with a retest of the lower range of the ongoing ascending channel pattern, as mentioned earlier. 
However, crypto trader HTL-NL pointed out the possibility of a long-term correction below, forming new lows in 2025. The trader showed immediate support at $76,700, which might be a minor retest region before prices drop below $74,000. 
Likewise, Crypto Chase, a technical analyst, noted that it is a “do or die” situation for Bitcoin. In an X post, the trader said,

 Shares of Mara Holdings (MARA), Strategy (MSTR), and several other companies tied to cryptocurrencies fell Friday along with the price of Bitcoin (BTCUSD).

 Mara Holdings plunged 9%, Strategy dropped 10%, and Coinbase (COIN) fell 7%, as Bitcoin slid about 4% to just over $83,700 in recent trading. Ethereum (ETHUSD) and other popular cryptocurrencies also lost ground Friday.

 Stocks closely tied to the crypto industry often follow the price of Bitcoin higher or lower. The cryptocurrency and stocks fell Friday alongside the broader market, as the latest inflation and consumer sentiment data raised concerns about the state of the economy.

 The price Bitcoin surged in the weeks following Trump's election on expectations of a friendlier regulatory environment, surpassing $100,000 for the first time in December and setting a record high above $109,000 on the day of his inauguration. However, the cryptocurrency has fallen in recent weeks amid uncertainty over the economic impact of Trump's tariffs.

Bitcoin (BTC), hovering just below $88,000 a day ago, tumbled to $83,800 recently and is down 3.8% over the past 24 hours. The broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index declined 5.7%, with native cryptos Avalanche (AVAX), Polygon (POL), Near (NEAR), and Uniswap (UNI) all nursing almost 10% losses during the same period. Today's sell-off wiped out $115 billion of the total market value of cryptocurrencies, TradingView data shows.


Ethereum's ether (ETH) declined over 6% to extend its downtrend against BTC, falling to its weakest relative price to the largest cryptocurrency since May 2020. Underscoring the bearish trend, spot ETH exchange-traded funds failed to attract any net inflows since early March, while their BTC counterparts saw over $1 billion of inflows in the past two weeks, according to Farside Investors data.

The ugly crypto price action coincided with U.S. stocks selling off during the day on poor economic data, with the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index down 2% and 2.8%, respectively. Crypto-focused stocks also suffered heavy losses: Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate BTC holder, closed the day 10% lower, while crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) dropped 7.7%.

The February PCE inflation report, released this morning, showed a 2.5% year-over-year increase in the price index, with core inflation at 2.8%, slightly above expectations. Consumer spending showed a modest 0.4% rise, though inflation-adjusted figures indicate minimal growth, suggesting potential headwinds for economic growth. The Federal Reserve of Atlanta's GDPNow model now projects the U.S. economy to contract 2.8% in the first quarter, 0.5% adjusted for gold imports and exports, spurring stagflationary fears.

The implementation of broad-scale U.S. tariffs next week—the so-called ""Liberation Day' on April 2, as the Trump administration refers to—also compounded investor concerns across markets.

Bitcoin has closely correlated with the Nasdaq lately, so U.S. equities rolling over for another leg down could weigh on the broader crypto market. However, on a more optimistic note, today's decline could be BTC filling the price gap at around $84,000-$85,000 between Monday's open and the previous week's close on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures market. Historically, BTC usually revisited similar CME gaps and a drop to $84,000 was in the cards, CoinDesk senior analyst James Van Straten noted earlier this week.

""At this stage it’s difficult to determine if we have already seen a bottom in 2025,"" Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, said in a market note. Despite the on-going correction, he noted several positive trends such as crypto-friendly policies in the U.S. and more traditional financial firms entering the industry or expanding crypto offerings, which could bode well for digital assets later in the year.

""Any additional setbacks that we might see should be exceptionally well supported into the $70-75k area,"" he added.

 The pioneer cryptocurrency plunged 5% to around $79,000 as market participants braced for further market volatility after China on Friday responded to the Trump administration’s recently announced sweeping tariffs with retaliatory duties, heightening concerns of a drawn-out trade war that could trigger a worldwide recession.

 Bitcoin also continues to face selling pressure from liquidations, an event where falling prices force traders to sell their bullish bets on the cryptocurrency at a loss. According to crypto analytics site CoinGlass, bitcoin has suffered $250 million in long liquidations over the past 24 hours, the highest amount since March 7. Bitcoin has tumbled 15% year to date after more than doubling last year on expectations of regulatory tailwinds.

 Below, we take a closer look at bitcoin’s chart and apply technical analysis to identify key price levels worth watching out for amid a tariff-driven global market selling rout.

 After falling below the 200-day moving average (MA) last month, bitcoin’s price consolidated within a rising wedge before breaking down below the bearish pattern in late March, signaling a continuation move lower.

 Indeed, the cryptocurrency’s price has continued its downtrend, with declines accelerating on Sunday evening after a brief period of sideways drift. It’s also worth pointing out that the 50-day MA has crossed below the 200-day MA to form an ominous death cross, a chart pattern that warns of further selling.

 Let’s identify three key support levels on bitcoin’s chart that investors may be watching and also locate a major overhead area to eye during potential recovery efforts in the cryptocurrency's price.

 A breakdown below last month’s low could see a move to around $74,000. This area on bitcoin’s chart may provide support near a multi-month trendline that connects last year’s prominent March peak and late-October high that preceded November’s election-fueled breakout.

 The bulls’ failure to defend this important technical level could trigger a decline to the $65,000 level. The cryptocurrency’s price may attract support in this region near last year’s August and September peak’s, which closely align with the October trough. 

 Interestingly, this location also sits in the same neighborhood as a projected bars pattern downside target that takes bitcoin’s move lower from late January to early March and repositions it from the rising wedge pattern’s breakdown point.

 Further selling could bring the $57,000 level into play. Investors may look to accumulate bitcoin near last year’s May swing low, with the area also sitting just above three prominent troughs that formed on the chart between July and September.

 During potential recovery efforts in bitcoin's price, investors should eye the $87,000 area. This region currently provides a confluence of overhead resistance from the 50- and 200-day MAs and a range of comparable trading levels on the chart stretching back to early November last year.

 The pioneer cryptocurrency plunged 5% to around $79,000 as market participants braced for further market volatility after China on Friday responded to the Trump administration’s recently announced sweeping tariffs with retaliatory duties, heightening concerns of a drawn-out trade war that could trigger a worldwide recession.

 Bitcoin also continues to face selling pressure from liquidations, an event where falling prices force traders to sell their bullish bets on the cryptocurrency at a loss. According to crypto analytics site CoinGlass, bitcoin has suffered $250 million in long liquidations over the past 24 hours, the highest amount since March 7. Bitcoin has tumbled 15% year to date after more than doubling last year on expectations of regulatory tailwinds.

 Below, we take a closer look at bitcoin’s chart and apply technical analysis to identify key price levels worth watching out for amid a tariff-driven global market selling rout.

 After falling below the 200-day moving average (MA) last month, bitcoin’s price consolidated within a rising wedge before breaking down below the bearish pattern in late March, signaling a continuation move lower.

 Indeed, the cryptocurrency’s price has continued its downtrend, with declines accelerating on Sunday evening after a brief period of sideways drift. It’s also worth pointing out that the 50-day MA has crossed below the 200-day MA to form an ominous death cross, a chart pattern that warns of further selling.

 Let’s identify three key support levels on bitcoin’s chart that investors may be watching and also locate a major overhead area to eye during potential recovery efforts in the cryptocurrency's price.

 A breakdown below last month’s low could see a move to around $74,000. This area on bitcoin’s chart may provide support near a multi-month trendline that connects last year’s prominent March peak and late-October high that preceded November’s election-fueled breakout.

 The bulls’ failure to defend this important technical level could trigger a decline to the $65,000 level. The cryptocurrency’s price may attract support in this region near last year’s August and September peak’s, which closely align with the October trough. 

 Interestingly, this location also sits in the same neighborhood as a projected bars pattern downside target that takes bitcoin’s move lower from late January to early March and repositions it from the rising wedge pattern’s breakdown point.

 Further selling could bring the $57,000 level into play. Investors may look to accumulate bitcoin near last year’s May swing low, with the area also sitting just above three prominent troughs that formed on the chart between July and September.

 During potential recovery efforts in bitcoin's price, investors should eye the $87,000 area. This region currently provides a confluence of overhead resistance from the 50- and 200-day MAs and a range of comparable trading levels on the chart stretching back to early November last year.

At time of writing, at 7.32 am on April 8, data on CoinMarketCap showed Bitcoin was up 2.09 per cent over the previous day, priced at $80,559.88 apiece. Its market capitalisation (market cap or mcap) is at $1.59 trillion and trading volume is at $88.59 billion.
Further, Bitcoin’s dominance is in the crypto market space is 62.79 per cent, an increase of 0.26 per cent over the day, the data showed.
“Currently trading at $80,700, BTC faces the next resistance at $84,000, with support remaining at $75,900,” according to Alankar Saxena, Co-founder and CTO of Mudrex.
Saxena said that Bitcoin’s rising long-term holder supply shows strong conviction despite volatility. He added that the cryptocurrency market is “on a recovery path, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana gaining up to 15 per cent from recent lows”.
“As global markets adjust to prolonged trade fragmentation and reciprocal tariffs, Bitcoin’s role as a safe-haven asset could become prominent, adding to its upward momentum,” Saxena believes.
According to CoinSwitch Markets Desk, Bitcoin briefly dipped to $74,600 before rebounding to $80,800. “Bitcoin is currently trading around the $80,000 mark, up 2.2 per cent over the past 24 hours. Approximately $377 million worth of the token was liquidated during this period. It remains below both its 50-day and 100-day moving averages,” it said. 
“Altcoins saw a modest recovery, with XRP, SOL, TRX, and ADA posting gains of 1.6 per cent, 4.9 per cent, 2.3 per cent, and 4.6 per cent, respectively,” CoinSwitch Markets Desk added.
So, what to look out for? According to Saxena, “all eyes are now on the upcoming US CPI data, which could influence market sentiment. A softer-than-expected inflation data could trigger a trend reversal across markets.”
According to Coinglass, bullish crypto bets of around $1.5 billion were sold in the past 24 hours — the highest in 2025. Sean McNulty, head of APAC derivatives at digital-asset prime brokerage FalconX, told Bloomberg that the Options markets suggest the selling pressure may continue “with the skew for puts picking up considerably”.
According to CoinMarketCap, the global cryptocurrency market cap is at $2.55 trillion on April 8, a 1.55 per cent increase over the last day. Further, the total crypto market volume is $200.99 billion, up 89.81 per cent.
The world's second biggest token Ether (Ethereum network) is at $1,589.05, up 0.36 per cent over the past 24 hours. Its mcap is at $191.76 billion, with volume of $44.73 billion.
US Dollar linked stablecoin Tether is at $0.9995, with market cap of $144.12 billion and trading volume of $155.44 billion.
While Donald Trump's favoured crypto network token Solana is at $110.90 apiece on April 8, with market cap of $57.17 billion and volume of $8.55 billion.

 Shares of cryptocurrency-tied companies jumped along with the price of bitcoin Wednesday afternoon after President Donald Trump issued a 90-day pause on widespread ""reciprocal"" tariffs.

 Bitcoin (BTCUSD), which traded as low as $74,500 Wednesday morning, was trading below $77,000 when President Trump wrote in a Truth Social post just after 1:15 p.m. ET that he was pausing the duties effective immediately, and that a base tariff of 10% on most countries. The largest cryptocurrency soon soared, along with risk assets like equities, surging to roughly $83,000 in recent trading.

 Shares of bitcoin buyer Strategy (MSTR), formerly known as MicroStrategy, and trading platform Robinhood Markets (HOOD) jumped 24% and 22%, respectively. Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) soared 19%, bitcoin miner MARA Holdings (MARA) added 17%, and Riot Platforms (RIOT) gained 11%.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell 0.1% in March. Economists had expected a 0.1% increase, following February’s 0.2% gain. On a year-over-year basis, headline CPI increased just 2.4% compared to forecasts of 2.6% and February’s 2.8%.
Core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, climbed only 0.1% in March against forecasts 0.3% and February’s 0.2% reading. Core CPI rose 2.8% year-over-year, well shy of expectations for 3% and and February’s 3.1%.
The price of bitcoin (BTC) rose modestly to above $82,000 in the minutes following the news. After yesterday's historic move higher, U.S. stock index futures are under pressure on Thursday morning, the Nasdaq 100 -2.7% and S&P 500 2.1%.
Thursday morning's CPI report, of course, contains data from prior to President Trump's ""Liberation Day"" sweeping tariff announcements last week that sent market into a multi-day panic, a portion of which was recovered yesterday following the president's 90-day pause.
Prior to the tariff pause and market recovery, traders had been busily pricing in a rate cut to come at the Fed's next meeting in May. Just prior to the CPI data, though, those odds had been whittled back to just 17%. For now, June is looking like the action meeting, with a 75% chance of 25 basis points or more of rate cuts by the end of that event.
Looking ahead, attention turns to Friday’s Producer Price Index (PPI) report, which may further shape expectations for Fed policy in May.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is predicting a “kerfuffle” in the US Treasury market that will trigger an intervention from the Federal Reserve. 
In other words, the money printer could get switched on again soon. 
On Friday, a top Fed official said they are ready to help stabilise the market if needed, reported the Financial Times.
Treasury yields have already begun showing signs of volatility, with the 10-year yield soaring to 4.5% from 3.9% earlier this month. 
Bitcoin is up 5.5% to $83,750 in the past 24 hours.
Volatility has been the name of the game since Donald Trump took office. The US president kicked off a tariff war against all major trading partners, which has shaken capital markets.
On Wednesday, assets finally took a breather when he announced a 90-day delay for “reciprocal” tariffs on imported goods from all countries except China. 
Trump did maintain a 10% tariff on those countries, however. And he raised tariffs on China to a whopping 145%. 
For Bitcoin, a Fed intervention could provide the legs for its next price rally. 
According to Bloomberg, Dimon reckons the turmoil is due to “all the rules and regulations” and believes the Fed will only step in when officials “start to panic a little bit.”
He is advocating for a number of bank rule changes. 
Indeed, the connection between Treasury market instability and Bitcoin’s price lies in the response to monetary policy that the Federal Reserve has. When regulators loosen bank capital requirements — a rule change that Dimon is looking for — excess liquidity often flows into risk assets such as cryptocurrencies. 
Dimon’s words made crypto pundits tingle with excitement. 
Arthur Hayes, Maelstrom CIO and crypto angel investor, said “What Jamie Dimon wants, Jamie Dimon gets.”
“SLR exemption is what we need to send BTC orbital.”
SLR stands for “Supplementary Leverage Ratio.” It is a key banking regulation that requires large banks to hold a minimum amount of capital against their total leverage exposure.
If Fed removes the SLR, it will increase liquidity and allow banks to take more risks. 
So what does this all mean? 
“We are about to enter UP ONLY mode for BTC,” said Hayes.

The most recent University of Michigan survey, published on Friday, found that consumer sentiment fell to 50.8 from 57.0, nearing the most depressed level in three years and far below that seen during the 2020 Covid shutdowns. Year-ahead inflation expectations surged to 6.7%, up from 5% in the prior month and the highest read since 1981.

On the back of the data, investors resumed selling long-term U.S. government bonds and the greenbacks, two assets traditionally considered as safe havens. The 10-year Treasury yield soared above 4.55% during U.S. morning hours, up more than 50 basis points in just a week. Meanwhile the dollar index (DXY) sank below 100 to a three-year low. Gold, meanwhile, hit a fresh record of $3,240 per ounce.

After a wildly volatile past few sessions, U.S. stocks were trading in a far tighter range on both sides of unchanged on Friday. At press time, the Nasdaq was higher by 0.6%

Meanwhile, cryptocurrency markets were moving higher, with bitcoin (BTC) holding just above $82,000, gaining 4% over the past 24 hours. The broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index was up 3%, with altcoin majors Solana's SOL, Avalanche's AVAX leading with 6% gains.



While some macroeconomic analysts are fearful that the recent surge in government bond yields is threatening the future outlook of the U.S. economy, others believe investors are reading too much into short-term market swings.

""U.S. dollars and U.S. government debt, two of the market’s most liquid safe haven categories, are going haywire,"" Noelle Achison, analyst and author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, said in a Friday note. ""This is not the case for other safe havens, however, just those directly tied to the U.S.""

“I believe that it is much more likely that recent sharp moves in these asset classes is due to highly leveraged market participants being forced out of positions than due to fundamentals,” said billionaire investor Bill Ackmann in a post on X.

“Technical factors are driving the dramatic market moves,"" Ackman continued. ""As a result, markets have become increasingly unreliable as short-term indicators of the impact of policy changes.""

These exclusions, published by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, list products from President Donald Trump's 125% China tariff and his baseline 10% global levy. 
""The US imports over $60 BILLION of smartphones per year. These exemptions cover some of the most crucial imports in another sign of the U.S. conceding in the trade war. After all, the bond market is forcing Trump to concede,"" The Kobeissi Letter said on X. 
The U.S. and China ratcheted up trade tensions this week, imposing import tariffs in excess of 100% over each other. Still, some sections of the financial market have priced in disinflation in the U.S., going against popular inflation fears and suggesting that the Fed might soon have a leeway to cut interest rates. 
The chart shows that BTC is looking to establish a foothold above the descending trendline, characterizing the steep sell-off from record highs above $109K. The so-called trendline breakout could entice more chart-driven buyers to the market.
Meanwhile, major alternative cryptocurrencies like ETH, XRP, and ADA surged by 6% on the day, indicating a trend of increased risk-taking in the broader crypto market. The cumulative market cap of the top two stablecoins, USDT and USDC, held steady above $200 billion, just shy of record highs.
This positive momentum in the crypto market, which opened for trading over the weekend, suggests the potential for price gains on Wall Street come Monday.

Michael Saylor, co-founder and executive chairman of Strategy Inc. MSTR, hinted at a resumption of its Bitcoin BTC/USD buying streak following a week’s pause.
What happened: Saylor took to X on Sunday to post a chart that tracks the company's Bitcoin purchases, with a cryptic caption, ""No Tariffs on Orange Dots.""

Notably, similar Sunday posts with mysterious messaging have piqued the market's interest recently, as they have almost always preceded Bitcoin acquisitions the following Monday. 
If Saylor's firm does announce BTC buys on Monday, it'd mark a resumption after a week's pause. In a recent SEC filing, Strategy revealed that no additional BTC was purchased during the week ending April 6.

As of this writing, Strategy's Bitcoin stockpile has grown to 528,185 BTCs, worth $44.68 billion, with an unrealized profit of 25%, according to  bitcointreasuries.com.
Why It Matters: Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market witnessed a much-needed rebound last week after President Donald Trump relaxed his sweeping tariff measures, which had been the sector’s undoing recently.
However, Bitcoin mining, a critical part of the industry, may face disruptions, as most U.S.-based miners rely on China for supplies of application-specific integrated circuits and the equipment that includes these chips. 
Analyst John Todaro warned that material costs for core infrastructure at U.S. Bitcoin mining sites could rise by roughly 20%, threatening to cut into miners' profits.
Notably, the U.S. has raised import duties on Chinese goods to a whopping 145% as a result of the uncompromising stance taken by the two countries.
Price Action:  At the time of writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $84,717.19, up 0.41% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. 
Shares of Strategy were up 2.21% in pre-market trading after closing 10.2% higher at $299.98 during Friday's regular session. 
MSTR demonstrated a high momentum score—a measure of the stock’s relative strength based on its price movement patterns and volatility over multiple timeframes—as of this writing. To find out similar high-momentum stocks,  go to Benzinga Edge Stock Rankings.

Trader Notes: Prominent trader Crypto Kaleo expects Bitcoin dominance to peak soon, which would spark a rally in altcoins compared to Bitcoin.
Analyst Altcoin Sherpa has bad news for Ethereum investors, stating that “you shouldn’t long this coin” until it shows strength. He does not expect a reversal any time soon and expects Ethereum to hit 2019 levels on the Bitcoin trading pair.
Trader Cold Blooded shiller highlights $87,000 as a key level for a “significant change in market momentum,” which would provide the “simplest, cleanest long setup in two months.”
Above $87,000 for $BTC would mark a significant change in the market momentum.You can also see this simplicity on the candle chart with the RSI consistently rejecting at the 50 level.When these break upwards it'll be the simplest, cleanest long set ups we've seen in 2 months. https://t.co/Rp417jDODQ pic.twitter.com/5ls0Va8DDg

Since a “wave of negative sentiment” formed in February, digital asset products have shed $7.2 billion worth of assets, the most dramatic stretch of outflows on record, CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill wrote in a report on Monday.
But he cautioned against substantial concern over last week's outflows of $795 million across tracked crypto funds, including $751 million from Bitcoin ETFs and nearly $38 million from Ethereum funds.
“I don’t see this as anything particularly ominous or alarming at this point,” Butterfill told Decrypt. “If you look outside the institutional ETF market, we’ve seen Bitcoin prices, in general, outperform that of equities since ‘Liberation Day.’”
Indeed, Bitcoin has held up well against stock indices since U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled, and then mostly paused, tariffs on more than 180 nations earlier this month. Bitcoin initially surged this weekend after the White House indicated that computer chips and smartphones would be exempt from levies, but slid on Sunday after Trump clarified that “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook.’”
On Monday, the leading cryptocurrency recently rose toward $85,000, showing a 0.4% increase over the past day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. On Wall Street, the tech-heavy Nasdaq had meanwhile edged up 0.88%, per Yahoo Finance.
Year-to-date, investors have allocated $545 million to Bitcoin funds and $241 million to Ethereum funds.
After Bitcoin fell as low as $74,700 a week ago, the average investor has appeared willing to buy the dip, but institutions are showing continued pessimism with outflows stretching into their third straight week, Butterfill said.
“Retail [investors] are clearly buying now, but we’re not seeing that on the institutional side,” he said. “It does suggest that institutions are not seeing this as an opportunity just yet.”
Products tracking various cryptocurrencies generated outflows across the board last week, except for XRP. As funds tied to Ethereum and Solana lost $38 and $5 million, respectively, investors allocated $3.5 million to the Ripple-linked token.
Although it does not track XRP’s spot price, the first XRP ETF debuted in the U.S. last week. Dubbed the ​​Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF, the leveraged ETF debuted last Tuesday.
After pouring $44 billion into products including spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds last year, investors have now allocated just $165 million so far in 2025, CoinShares said.

The largest cryptocurrency was up 1.6% in the last 24 hours and is now trading just shy of $85,000. Ether (ETH), meanwhile, rose 2.7% in the same period of time to $1,630. The broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index — consisted of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization except for stablecoins, memecoins and exchange coins — advanced 1.2%, led by gains in SOL and AVAX.

After a couple of wild weeks, the stock market also edged higher today, the Nasdaq closing with a 0.6% gain and the S&P 500 rising 0.8%. Strategy (MSTR) and MARA Holdings (MARA), led among crypto stocks with roughly 3% gains.

The modest rally came as Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller signalling that a return of the original punitive Trump tariffs would trigger the need for sizable ""bad news"" rate cuts.

""[Tariff] effects on output and employment could be longer-lasting and an important factor in determining the appropriate stance of monetary policy,"" said Waller in a speech. ""If the slowdown is significant and even threatens a recession, then I would expect to favor cutting the FOMC's policy rate sooner, and to a greater extent than I had previously thought.""

Further easing concerns was the European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, confirming to hold off on retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods worth €21 billion until July 14 to ""allow space for negotiations.""

Odds that the U.S. and EU will reach a trade agreement to avoid tariffs rose to 65% on blockchain-based prediction market Polymarket after U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly stated that a deal was in the works.

Bitcoin's relief rally from last week's tariff turmoil stalled out around the $85,000 resistance level, but the network's improving fundamentals spur hopes for a breakout, crypto analytics firm SwissBlock Technologies noted.
""Since March, we’ve seen a consistent inflow of new participants,"" Swissblock analysts wrote in a Telegram broadcast. ""Liquidity is stabilizing, no more erratic swings from early 2025.""


""Once the liquidity gauge holds above the 50 line, short-term price action tends to follow with strength,"" Swissblock analysts said. ""With network growth aligning, key levels aren’t just being revisited, they're being accumulated.""

""This is the kind of structural support that underpins sustainable rallies,"" they concluded.

        Share    
On-chain data from CryptoQuant suggests that Bitcoin could be on the verge of a bullish trend reversal, as a key market signal begins to shift.
In an Apr. 13 post, CryptoQuant contributor Joao Wedson noted that the gap between Bitcoin’s (BTC) futures price and its spot price on Binance is starting to shrink. This gap, known as the perpetual-spot gap, shows the difference between what traders are paying in futures contracts versus the actual price of Bitcoin. 
Given that the gap is currently negative, futures market participants may be exercising caution or taking profits following Bitcoin’s previous surge to almost $90,000. However, the narrowing gap may indicate that selling pressure is easing. In the past, Bitcoin’s price often experienced a significant increase when this gap turned positive. This occurred in 2020 and early in 2024.
Despite Bitcoin falling over 22% from its all-time high of $108,786 in January, on-chain accumulation signals remain strong. According to an Apr. 11 post on X by Glassnode, around 40,000 BTC has been purchased near the $79,000 level, while roughly 51,000 BTC was accumulated at around $82,080. If prices decline once more, these levels might serve as support. 
Looking at Cost Basis Distribution, #Bitcoin has built notable support at $79K, with ~40K $BTC accumulated there. It has also worked through the $82.08K cluster (~51K $BTC). If this level holds, the next to test is $83.5K, with 48.5K $BTC positioned: https://t.co/YqeQ2uWJlV pic.twitter.com/9aE3UdsT2O
Bitcoin is trading at about $84,746 as of press time, having recovered from a weekly low of $74,773. The cryptocurrency is up 7% in the last week. Recently, Bitcoin closed a daily candle above a long-term downtrend line, leading well-known market analyst Rekt Capital to speculate that a breakout might be imminent. They did, however, warn that a successful retest is required to confirm the trend change.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s dominance, which measures its share of the whole cryptocurrency market, sits at 63%, as per TradingView data. This indicates that a sizable amount of market capital is still allocated to Bitcoin, suggesting that investors are banking on its relative stability in volatile markets. If buyers continue to step in and the futures gap turns positive, analysts believe that Bitcoin might be poised for another rally.

Bitcoin (BTC) price approaches its key resistance level at $85,000 on Monday; a breakout indicates a bullish trend ahead. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) found support around their key levels last week, suggesting a recovery is in the cards.
Bitcoin price broke and closed above its descending trendline (drawn by connecting multiple high levels since mid-January) on Friday and rallied 2.22% the next day. However, on Sunday, it faced rejection at the $85,000 level, which coincides with the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the daily resistance level. At the time of writing on Monday, it trades at around $84,000. 
If BTC breaks and closes above $85,000, it could extend the rally to the key psychological level of $90,000. A successful close above this level could extend an additional rally to test its March 2 high of $95,000.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart flattens around its neutral level of 50, indicating indecisiveness among traders. The RSI must move above its neutral level for the bullish momentum to be sustained.
BTC/USDT daily chart
If BTC fails to close above $85,000 and continues its downward trend, it could extend the decline to retest its next daily support level at $73,072.
Ethereum price found support around its daily level of $1,449 last week, recovered slightly, but faced resistance around $1,700. At the time of writing on Monday, it hovers at around $1,638.
If ETH continues its recovery and closes above $1,700, it could extend the rally to retest its next daily resistance at $1,861.
The RSI on the daily chart reads 42 after bouncing off its oversold level of 30 last week. It points upward toward its neutral level of 50, indicating fading bearish momentum. The RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the bullish momentum to be sustained.
ETH/USDT daily chart
Conversely, if ETH closes below its daily support level of $1,449, it could extend the decline to retest its important psychological level of $1,300.
XRP price recovered by 14.28%, breaking above its 200-day EMA at $1.95 on Wednesday. It declined by 4.24% the next day, and the 200-day EMA level was tested. XRP continued its recovery and retested its April 2 high of $2.23 on Sunday. At the time of writing on Monday, it stabilizes at around $2.14.
If XRP breaks and closes above $2.23, it could extend the rally to retest its March 24 high of $2.50.
The RSI on the daily chart reads 50 and points upward toward its neutral level of 50, indicating the bearish momentum is fading. The RSI must maintain its level above 50 for the recovery rally to be sustained.
XRP/USDT daily chart
On the other hand, if XRP closes below its 200-day EMA, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $1.77.
Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.
Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 
Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

        Share    
Bitcoin price remained under pressure below the 50-day moving average as the fear and greed index held at the fear zone.
Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at $84,000 on Monday, just below the key resistance level at $85,000. This price is about 13.4% above its lowest level this month.
The coin’s movement followed Donald Trump’s decision to exempt certain items like smartphones and other electronic goods from recently announced tariffs. While equities initially surged following the news, much of those gains were later erased. The Nasdaq 100 index, for example, was up by only 90 points after earlier rising more than 500 points.
One key reason behind Bitcoin’s underperformance is that investor sentiment remains cautious. Many traders continue to stay on the sidelines. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded outflows of over $713 million last week, following losses of $172 million the previous week.
The crypto fear and greed index tracked by CoinMarketCap remains in the “fear” zone at 27, while the CNN Money index is sitting even lower in the “extreme fear” zone at 21. Historically, these levels indicate risk-averse behavior, with fewer investors willing to take on exposure during uncertain conditions.
Meanwhile, futures open interest has moved sideways in recent days. According to CoinGlass, open interest remains stuck at $56 billion, reflecting ongoing weakness in futures demand and trader conviction.
The daily chart shows Bitcoin remains under pressure. Price action has stalled around $84,400, a key level just beneath the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages. A potential crossover of these two indicators could form a death cross, a bearish technical signal suggesting further downside.
Bitcoin also continues to trade below a descending trendline that connects the major swing highs since January 20. It’s currently near the lower boundary of its trading range, as defined by the Murrey Math Lines.
Given these signals, there’s a risk that BTC could resume its downtrend, with sellers potentially targeting the recent double-bottom support at $76,800. However, this bearish outlook would be invalidated if Bitcoin breaks above the descending trendline and both moving averages. A sustained move above these resistance points would also negate the death cross setup and point to a possible bullish reversal.

The global crypto market momentum retreated 2% on Monday after United States (US) inflation data triggered double-digit gains for top-ranked over the weekend. 
In terms of positive discourse, Solana and Ethereum markets are leaning bullish after Donald Trump recently repealed a Biden-approved law involving DeFi platforms. 
However, markets continue to hang in the balance as non-US markets remain jittery. 

Saylor’s cryptic statement on Sunday came after Strategy Q1 filings revealed $6 billion unrealized losses on all Bitcoin acquisitions since the year began.
The company acquired 80,785 BTC to its balances since the beginning of the year after raising $7.69 billion in Q1, majorly through common stock sales.

Bitcoin ETF Flows April 2025 | Source: Farside data
According to Farside data, Bitcoin ETFs shed over $872 million in a seven-day selling spree on April 3. 

However, a closer look shows that the outflows declined to just $1 million on Friday, after an over $700 million sell-off in the first four days of the week. 
This signals that the selling pressure from US-based corporate investors declined significantly after the US CPI data report. If the improvement in sentiment lingers through Monday, BTC ETFs could flip into buying mode, potentially keeping Bitcoin prices above $85,000 as the US trading session kicks off. 

Altcoin market update: Mantra token plunges; Solana and Ethereum traders maintain bullish outlook 
Altcoins showed mixed performances on Monday, as investors continue to rotate capital to capitalize on volatile market trends and news narratives for short-term gains.
Crypto Market Performance, April 14 2025 | Coingecko
Shedding 2% each, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Toncoin (TON), Hedera (HBAR)  are the only top 25 ranked altcoins posting losses on the 24-hour timeframe. Mantra (OM) tumbled nearly 91.2% on Monday amid speculation of insider trading and market manipulation. 
Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) traders are in green with 2% and 4% upticks, respectively. 
This shows a narrative that investors are rotating funds into DeFi-focused protocols to capitalize on the positive headwinds from Trump’s decision to repeal a Biden-approved law that classified DeFi platforms as brokers to compel stringent KYC measures. 
Combining derivatives trading data observed on Monday, the data aligns with the narrative that ETH and SOL are receiving unusual bullish bets relative to the rest of the market.

Looking at the broader market trends, total long liquidations hit $216.7 million, exceeding short liquidations of $137.6 million. However, ETH and SOL markets stood out, with short traders booking the majority of the 24-hour losses in both markets. 

Trump’s move to repeal a Biden-era rule that classified DeFi platforms as brokers has triggered fresh optimism across the decentralized finance space. This regulatory U-turn appears to be fueling capital rotation into DeFi-aligned Layer-1s like Ethereum and Solana.

ETH and SOL traders, supported by this positive legislative backdrop, appear to be doubling down on long positions despite rising liquidation risks. Their 24-hour gains and resilience amid market volatility support the idea that a new bullish narrative is forming.
Waylon Wilcox of Dillsburg, Pennsylvania, has pleaded guilty to federal tax evasion charges after failing to report over $13 million in profits from the sale of 97 CryptoPunk NFTs. According to the US Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, Wilcox deliberately avoided paying approximately $3.3 million in taxes owed on the income.
The case marks a significant enforcement action in the realm of digital asset taxation. The IRS reiterated the legal obligation to report virtual currency transactions, including those involving NFTs. Wilcox’s guilty plea underscores the growing scrutiny of crypto-related income as US authorities intensify oversight of blockchain-based financial activities.
Lomond School in Helensburgh, Scotland, has announced it will begin accepting Bitcoin as a form of tuition payment, making it the first school in the United Kingdom to do so. The decision comes in response to increasing demand from both local and international parents seeking alternative payment methods.
The school plans to implement Bitcoin payments in phases and will convert the received cryptocurrency into pound sterling to mitigate financial risks. In addition, Lomond School is considering creating a Bitcoin reserve, contingent on broader national and international acceptance of the digital asset.
JPMorgan's blockchain-focused subsidiary, Kinexys, has introduced British pound-denominated deposit accounts in the UK, expanding its blockchain-based payment services. The new feature adds GBP functionality to existing euro and dollar offerings, enabling around-the-clock cross-border transactions and more flexible foreign exchange settlement options.
Since its launch, Kinexys has processed over $1.5 trillion in transactions. Corporate clients, including LSEG's SwapAgent and commodities trading firm Trafigura are among the first users of the new GBP blockchain service.

        Share    
Japanese Bitcoin treasury company Metaplanet has achieved a BTC Yield of 108.3% year-to-date in 2025.
In an April 14 X post, Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich said the company now holds 4,525 BTC, worth roughly $386.3 million, at an average cost of around $85,366 per coin
The announcement followed Metaplanet’s latest purchase of 319 BTC for approximately ¥3.78 billion (or $26.3 million), acquired at an average price of ¥11.85 million (~$82,549) per Bitcoin.
To track the effectiveness of its treasury strategy, Metaplanet relies on BTC Yield, a metric that measures the growth of its Bitcoin holdings relative to its fully diluted share count. As previously reported by crypto.news, the metric surged 309.8% in Q4 2024 and 95.6% in the first quarter of 2025.
Earlier this month, the Tokyo-listed firm added 160 BTC to its treasury for around $13.4 million. Metaplanet is aiming to accumulate over 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and ultimately reach 21,000 BTC by 2026.
To support this aggressive strategy, Metaplanet has been raising funds through a mix of equity and debt, including a series of zero-coupon bond issuances and stock acquisition rights with EVO FUND. Since January, it has issued 21 million shares across five tranches under its “210 Million Plan.” 
Most recently, it exercised 8.6 million and 4.2 million shares under its 14th and 17th stock rights series, raising over ¥35 billion to date, which accounts for roughly 42% of the planned 21 million share issuance.
The company has completed early redemptions on several bond tranches, including its 9th Series, which was fully repaid ahead of schedule. Originally maturing in September 2025, the ¥2 billion issuance was redeemed using proceeds from EVO FUND’s exercise of the 13th to 17th stock rights series.
Last month, it announced plans to raise ¥2 billion ($13.3 million) through its 10th Series of Ordinary Bonds issued on March 31.
According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, Metaplanet is currently the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in Asia. 
Globally, U.S.-based Strategy remains the largest corporate holder of the flagship crypto with 528,185 BTC worth approximately $44.5 billion in their stash. However, the company recently alerted share holders it may have to sell part of its Bitcoin stash to meet financial obligations if it fails to raise fresh capital.

        Share    
Bitcoin treasury company Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has acquired another 3,459 BTC for $285.8 million between April 7 and April 13.
Michael Saylor’s Strategy continues aggressively accumulating Bitcoin (BTC) despite the cryptocurrency’s lack of energy to return to the $100,000 mark.
In a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 14, Strategy disclosed that it had purchased 3,459 BTC for $285.8 million during the April 7–13 period, using cash proceeds raised from selling nearly 960,000 MSTR shares.
$MSTR has acquired 3,459 BTC for ~$285.8 million at ~$82,618 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 11.4% YTD 2025. As of 4/13/2025, @Strategy holds 531,644 $BTC acquired for ~$35.92 billion at ~$67,556 per bitcoin. https://t.co/IUbf4TFD3d
In an X post on Monday, Saylor revealed that the Virginia-based public company acquired Bitcoin at an average price of approximately $82,618 per BTC, achieving a BTC yield of 11.4% since the start of 2025. With the latest acquisition, Strategy now holds 531,644 BTC, purchased for nearly $36 billion at an average cost of $67,556 per coin.
The purchase comes just a few days after Strategy warned that it may be forced to offload some of its Bitcoin holdings if it cannot raise sufficient funds through equity or debt. The company is carrying approximately $8 billion in debt, with $35 million in annual interest obligations and an additional $150 million in yearly dividend payments. For Q1, it expects to report an unrealized loss of nearly $6 billion, though it also projects a $1.69 billion tax benefit.

        Share    
Outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. surged last week as investor sentiment took a hit from rising trade tensions driven by President Trump’s aggressive tariff plans.
According to SoSoValue data, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $713.3 million pulled out, over 300% more than the $172.7 million outflows from the week before.
Every single day from April 7 to 11 saw money being pulled, continuing a streak that began on April 3. The biggest drop came on Tuesday, with $326.27 million in outflows, while Friday ended the week with just over $1 million leaving.
BlackRock’s IBIT took the hardest hit with $342.6 million in outflows, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC with $160.9 million and Fidelity’s FBTC with $74.6 million per Faside data. Other ETFs, like BITB, BTCO, ARKB, EZBC, BTCW, and HODL, also saw outflows ranging from about $11 million to $38 million.
The only ETF to buck the bearish trend was Grayscale’s mini Bitcoin Trust, which recorded $2.4 million in net inflows, while Valkyrie’s BRRR saw no flows during the week.
Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs didn’t fare much better than their Bitcoin counterparts, with outflows jumping 65% to $82.47 million last week. It’s now the seventh straight week of Ethereum ETF withdrawals, adding up to more than $877 million in total.
The main driver behind all this seems to be the uncertainty around Trump’s new tariff plans. He originally announced a 10% flat tariff on all imports starting in April, with even higher rates for major trading partners. 
Markets cooled off a bit on April 9, when he paused the tariff hikes for 75 allied countries. That relief didn’t last long. The U.S. then raised some tariffs on Chinese goods to as high as 145%, accusing China of unfair trade. 
In response, China hit back with tariffs of up to 125% on U.S. goods and stopped exporting rare-earth minerals. This ramped up fears of a full-blown trade war and made investors nervous about riskier assets like Bitcoin.
At the time of writing, the overall crypto market was down around 2.1% in the past day. Despite this, Bitcoin has bounced from last week’s low of $74,773 to nearly $84,500 by Monday, April 14.
According to some analysts, Bitcoin (BTC) is on the verge of breaking out of its long downtrend. They note that the price is just hours away from making the first key move that could kick off a new uptrend phase.

Welcome to the US Morning Crypto News Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead.
Grab a coffee to see how financial markets are performing in what could be the start of a broader global risk-off shift, particularly as monetary tightening returns to center stage in Asia and the West.
Japan’s 30-year bond yield has surged to the highest level in 20 years, trending as the top US crypto news today. Specifically, it has increased by 12 basis points (bps) to 2.345%, the highest level since 2004. This signals deepening stress in global fixed-income markets.
It is bearish on Bitcoin (BTC) and risk-on assets. Agne Linge, director of growth at decentralized on-chain bank WeFi, agrees that growing bond yields threaten crypto in the short term.
In an email to BeInCrypto, Linge said a major shift might be in the pipeline for risk assets. She cited macroeconomic trends in Japan as they pertain to the current surge in the 30-year bond yield.
“With the bond yield jumping 2.345% to its highest level in 30 years, more risk-averse institutional investors might shun Bitcoin and other speculative assets,” Linge stated.
As Japan’s long-term bond yields surge, pressure is mounting on the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to respond with a possible interest rate hike. Analysts say this could happen as early as the end of April.
If the BoJ tightens policy, it would mark a significant shift for a central bank that has maintained ultra-loose monetary conditions for decades.
 “If this forecast plays out as expected, it might lead to dried-up liquidity in the traditional financial market. Since crypto thrives more on excess monetary liquidity, this could also influence the performance of the asset shortly,” she added.
Linge cited the yen carry trade as one of the risk mechanisms. In this strategy, global investors borrow yen at low interest rates to invest in higher-yielding assets abroad. Trade thrives when Japanese rates are low and the international risk appetite is strong.
As Japanese yields rise and the prospect of a BoJ rate hike grows, the incentive to borrow yen diminishes. This could lead to an unwinding of the carry trade, potentially draining liquidity from global markets.
Such an outcome would amplify downside risk for crypto and other risk assets, which aligns with BeInCrypto’s recent report that Bitcoin’s price is at risk as the reverse yen carry trade unwinds.
“The problem today is that those borrowing costs are starting to get more expensive. Traders who were able to access virtually free capital for years are now finding themselves sitting on costly margin positions that they’re potentially being forced to unwind,” 5x Dow & Founders award winner and portfolio manager Michael A. Gayed said recently.
Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve (Fed) is facing increasing pressure to cut interest rates. Consumer inflation data from the US CPI and PPI (Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index, respectively) support this push. Lge observes that dovish signals in the US could partially offset this emerging hawkish stance from Japan.
“Since the US is a bigger market, the world may respond more toward the country’s monetary policies than Japan,” Linge added.
The Fed’s move to ease monetary conditions while Japan tightens could create a mixed global liquidity environment. Ts could spur volatility as investors reassess cross-border capital flows.
Nonetheless, the yen carry trade remains especially vulnerable to the BoJ’s decisively hawkish shift. This could trigger a repricing of risk globally, curbing speculative flows and weakening the liquidity backdrop that crypto markets have benefited from in recent years.
Amidst these concerns, however, traders and analysts remain optimistic. Analysts at Deribit recently observed that markets switched from capitulation to aggressive bounce.
“Protective/Bear play BTC 75-78k Puts were dumped, and 85-100k Calls were lifted as BTC surged from 75-85k,” they wrote.
Deribit data corroborates this observation, showing the $100,000 call strike price was the most popular call option as of this writing, recording the highest open interest  T  s suggests bets that Bitcoin could draw toward this psychological milestone.

        Share    
Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem may finally be ready to take on the big players, as a new project leverages Bitcoin’s inherent security.
Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem has gained a new player, Babylon, that could shape its future. In a recent report, Nansen called the project potentially one of the most undervalued plays on Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem. 
Critically, Babylon enables users to earn staking rewards in Bitcoin terms without relying on wrapped assets or cross-chain bridges. In doing so, the protocol leverages Bitcoin’s inherent security and decentralization, offering a safer and more native alternative for staking.
The process, dubbed Bitcoin restaking, involves locking BTC into a script on the Bitcoin blockchain. The Babylon protocol then uses a Cosmos SDK transaction to verify whether the funds are on-chain. Once verified, the Babylon chain distributes rewards to BTC stakers in proportion to their holdings.
Since Bitcoin itself does not offer staking rewards, these incentives come from the Babylon chain, primarily via BABY token inflation. Its annual inflation rate of 8% is split evenly between Bitcoin and BABY stakers.
This means BABY token stakers are betting that the token’s growth will exceed the 8% inflation rate. For Bitcoin holders, however, the protocol creates a new revenue stream without giving up custody of their assets—protecting them from third-party risks such as hacking or rug pulls.
Over the past year, Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem has seen substantial growth. Its ecosystem reached an all-time high of nearly $8 billion in December of last year. Even after a subsequent correction to $5.27 billion, it still experienced more than 500% growth year over year. 
Developers and entrepreneurs are increasingly betting on Bitcoin DeFi due to its strong name recognition and vast user base. At the same time, they see decentralized finance as a way to unlock new use cases for the Bitcoin network.

        Share    
Despite recent market turbulence, 21Shares President Duncan Moir says crypto assets, including Bitcoin and Dogecoin, continue to offer valuable long-term diversification and are gaining momentum as legitimate components of investor portfolios.
Speaking on CNBC Monday morning, Moir addressed both the macro backdrop affecting Bitcoin (BTC) and the firm’s launch of a Dogecoin (DOGE) exchange-traded product in Europe.
Moir stated the volatility striking crypto has been more subdued than some may think, given the scale of macroeconomic shocks affecting other markets. Rather, volatility in the crypto is “just moving in line with broader assets.”
He pointed out that Bitcoin’s long-term volatility has been decreasing, particularly as more institutional allocators enter the space. In fact, we are at a point where “volatility for Bitcoin that is on par with equities,” he added.
While critics argue that Bitcoin’s behavior during inflationary spikes undermines its hedge status, Moir disagrees.
“The inflation hedge argument is still very much there,” he said. “Bitcoin has a fixed supply, and we expect it to continue to be seen as a store of value by new investors coming into the market.”
Moir also addressed 21Shares’ recent launch of a Dogecoin ETP in Europe, a move some questioned due to the meme coin’s historic volatility and unconventional origins. Moir defended the decision as both strategic and timely.
“Dogecoin has particularly interesting properties,” he said. “It started as a fun social token with perfect product-market fit, but it’s evolving toward a global payments currency. We’re seeing real use cases by large corporates now.”
He added that the ETP, which enables investors to access Dogecoin through a traditional financial product, is aimed at long-term holders, not short-term speculators.
“Whether it was an up market or a down market, it didn’t really matter to us,” he said. “We want to make crypto investing as easy as buying a stock.”

Moir emphasized that 21Shares’ Dogecoin product is the result of a rare, officially endorsed partnership with the Dogecoin community—signaling growing institutional interest in the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap.
“We’re really excited about this partnership because it’s highly unique,” he said. “You do not usually see these sorts of officially endorsed and exclusive arrangements.”

After seven straight days of outflows, institutional investors seem to have rekindled their love for Bitcoin ETFs. Since April 2, US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs have posted net inflows for the first time, drawing $1.47 million in fresh capital on Monday.
While this figure is modest, it marks a notable shift in sentiment and the first sign of renewed institutional appetite for Bitcoin exposure through regulated funds.
Last week, Bitcoin investment funds recorded $713.30 million in net outflows as the broader cryptocurrency market struggled to stay afloat amid the growing impact of Donald Trump’s escalating trade war rhetoric.
But the tide may be starting to turn.
On Monday, U.S.-listed spot BTC ETFs recorded $1.47 million in net inflows, marking the first capital flow into these funds since April 2. While the amount is modest, it breaks a nearly two-week drought and could signal a gradual shift in institutional sentiment toward BTC.
The largest daily net inflow came from BlackRock’s IBIT, attracting $36.72 million. This brings its total cumulative net inflows to $39.60 billion.
On the other hand, Fidelity’s FBTC recorded the largest net outflow on Monday, shedding $35.25 million in a single day. 
On the derivatives side, BTC’s futures open interest has edged higher over the past 24 hours, signaling increased derivatives activity. 
At press time, this sits at $56 billion, rising by 2% in the past day. Notably, during the same period, BTC’s period has climbed by 1.22%. 
BTC’s futures open interest refers to the total number of outstanding futures contracts that have yet to be settled. When it rises during a price uptick like this, it suggests that new money is entering the market to support the upward move, potentially reinforcing bullish momentum.
However, there’s a catch. While open interest in BTC futures has increased, the nature of these new positions appears to be bearish. This is evident in the coin’s funding rate, which has now flipped negative for the first time since April 2.
This means that more BTC traders are paying to hold short positions than longs, suggesting that a growing number of market participants are betting on a potential pullback despite the modest inflows into spot ETFs.
Moreover, the mood remains cautious on the options side. Today, there are more put contracts than calls, signaling that some traders may be hedging their bets or anticipating further downside, even as other indicators turn bullish.
Still, for BTC ETFs, any inflow after two weeks of silence feels like a win. With the broader market sentiment toward the coin turning increasingly bullish, it remains to be seen if this trend could persist for the remainder of the week.

Bitcoin miners continue to feel the crunch, with firms in the space selling more coins than usual to make ends meet. 
Data firm CryptoQuant said in a Tuesday report that miners last week stepped up their selling as the price of the biggest cryptocurrency dropped below $80,000. 
The firm said that on April 7, miners sold a total of 15,000 BTC—the third-largest daily outflow this year. That's at least $1.12 billion worth, based on the day's low price of less than $75,000.
Increased market volatility—in both the stock market and crypto sphere—was mainly caused by President Trump's erratic announcements on tariffs, leaving traders unsure of how to act. 
Miners, which are typically large industrial operations of specialized computers processing transactions and minting new coins for the cryptocurrency's network, are rewarded with new Bitcoin for their work. 
But when the price of the coin takes a hit, they may struggle to cover costs—and be forced to sell more coins to keep their businesses running.
""Miner margins have been pressured by lower prices, but also with depressed transaction fees, and a record-high Bitcoin network hash rate, which implies higher mining costs, sending their average operating margins down from 53% in late January to 33% today,"" CryptoQuant said. 
The firm added that Bitcoin remains in one of its least bullish phases since November 2022. Bitcoin hit a new high of nearly $109,000 per coin ahead of President Trump's inauguration, but has since struggled to rise above $90,000. 
Bitcoin is now trading for nearly $83,800, a modest jump of just 1% over the past 30 days, CoinGecko shows. However, it's up almost 9% over the last week after diving to nearly $75,000.
President Trump promised to help the crypto industry—especially Bitcoin miners. And while the new commander-in-chief has approved a national Bitcoin strategic reserve and his SEC has scrapped a number of high-profile lawsuits against crypto firms, mining is a tough business. 
Miners at this year's Mining Disrupt conference told Decrypt that the industry would continue to struggle as the mining difficulty and costs increase.

        Share    
Bitcoin remains under the spotlight as Anthony Pompliano, founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management, outlined a bullish long-term vision for the cryptocurrency in a recent CNBC interview. 
With Bitcoin (BTC) hovering around $85,000, following a recent dip to $76,000, Pompliano weighed in on Bitcoin’s place in the global financial landscape, comparing it to gold and hinting at major institutional and governmental developments ahead.
Bitcoin has kicked off 2025 down roughly 10%, while gold is up 20%. But Pompliano was quick to point out a key trend: over a one-year horizon, both assets are up about 35%. This divergence, he notes, is not uncommon.
“Gold usually leads these rallies and nobody really knows why that happens,” Pompliano said. “My kind of guess would be that a lof of the central banks and institutional investors they are either not approved to buy Bitcoin or they’re not used to running to Bitcoin in these moments of kind of geopolitical uncertainty. What we do soo though, is when gold runs about suggesting that central banks and institutional players tend to favor gold in times of geopolitical uncertainty.”
He added that typicall when gold runs higher around 100 days later Bitcoin not only “catches up” but “tends to run even harder due to its higher volatility.”
One of the most notable shifts is how investors are gaining exposure to Bitcoin. Pompliano noted a growing use of spot Bitcoin ETFs, not just by retail traders but also by sovereign wealth funds.
Pompliano highlighted a recent overlooked disclosure by an undisclosed sovereign fund that exposure to Bitcoin exposure through ETFs. This shows institutions “want price exposure without the regulatory and geopolitical complications of self-custody.”
Pompliano discussed details from a recent conversation with Bo Hines, executive director of the President’s Advisory Council for Digital Assets. The takeaway? The U.S. government is reportedly not just interested in holding confiscated Bitcoin, it may be looking to actively acquire more.
“They’re going to buy as much Bitcoin as they possibly can,” Pompliano said. 
While the methods of purchasing are still being debated, whether via selling revalued gold or using tariff revenues, he confirmed that an interagency task force is actively exploring the best route. That move, if finalized, could set the stage for an entirely new layer of geopolitical positioning around Bitcoin. As Pompliano puts it, “Other countries may be acquiring Bitcoin by mining; the U.S. might buy it outright.”

 Senior Contributor. 
Bitcoin and crypto prices have ricocheted wildly in recent weeks as U.S. president Donald Trump’s barrage of global trade tariffs fuels a dollar ""confidence crisis"" and fears of “collapse.”

The bitcoin price has bounced back from lows of around $75,000 per bitcoin in early April (despite Michael Saylor’s Strategy issuing a surprise bitcoin “sell” warning).
Now, as Wall Street banks prepare to face an “existential"" threat, billionaire Ray Dalio has warned the U.S. is hurtling toward a financial crisis and recession that could be worse than 2008—something that BlackRock’s head of crypto has predicted could be a “big catalyst” for the bitcoin price.

""I think that right now we are at a decision-making point and very close to a recession,"" Dalio, the founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates who issued a similar warning in 2007, told NBC. ""And I’m worried about something worse than [the 2008] recession if this isn’t handled well.”
Dalio said Trump’s aggressive pursuit of tariffs is causing a “breaking down of the monetary order,” adding to a lengthy X post from last week when he said, “we are seeing a classic breakdown of the major monetary, political, and geopolitical orders. This sort of breakdown occurs only about once in a lifetime, but they have happened many times in history when similar unsustainable conditions were in place.”
In a rapidly escalating trade war, Trump has slapped tariffs of up to 145% on many China exports to the U.S., while China has hit back with a 125% levy on U.S. products.
Globally, Trump has added a 10% tax on goods entering the U.S. while giving many countries a 90-day deal deadline before he reinstates a raft of much higher charges.
The global trade war saw the ICE U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. dollar against a basket of global currencies, fall sharply last week, dropping under the 100 level and putting it on course to return to its 2022 range.
The bitcoin price has climbed over the last month, despite recession fears taking hold. Betting markets are putting the odds of recession at between 40% to 60%, per Coindesk.
Last month, BlackRock’s head of digital assets Robbie Mitchnick predicted a recession could boost the bitcoin price.
“I don’t know if we’ll have a recession or not, but a recession would be a big catalyst for bitcoin,” Mitchnick told Yahoo Finance, pointing to how recession responses such as increased fiscal spending, deficit accumulation, lower interest rates and monetary stimulus have historically boosted the bitcoin price.

Bitcoin and crypto market watchers are feeling bullish about the bitcoin price outlook even as uncertainty bubbles up over tariffs and the economy.
“Bitcoin is consolidating at higher levels (and above where it was trading before Trump’s election win in November last year), and the structural groundwork—ranging from institutional infrastructure to sovereign-level interest—is being quietly laid,” analysts with the Bitfinex bitcoin and crypto exchange said in an emailed note. ""The market is coiled, not broken, and the coming months could bring significant upside if catalysts align.""
In December, Dalio warned of a looming ""debt crisis"" which he expects will trigger a sharp decline in the value of the U.S. dollar.
U.S. debt has soared over recent years, topping $35 trillion at the beginning of 2025, with Covid and lockdown stimulus measures contributing to massive government spending and helping to send inflation spiraling out of control in 2022.

Meme coins slid 4.8% Monday amid rising volatility, with investors fleeing low-liquidity tokens in favor of Bitcoin stability.
The meme coin market fell sharply on Monday, shedding 4.8% in market capitalization to settle at $49.25 billion, according to data compiled from CoinGecko. The sell-off coincided with increased volatility across broader crypto markets while investors rotated funds into Bitcoin briefly tested the $85,000, as positive sentiment triggers from the US inflation report subsided. 
The decline in meme coins reflects a flight from low-liquidity tokens as investors positioned themselves defensively as markets await the next upward catalyst, as the trade war between US and China rages on.
Memecoin market performance | Source: Coingecko 
As seen in the chart above, Dogecoin (DOGE), the sector's flagship asset with a $23.6 billion market cap, fell 2.1% over the past 24 hours to $0.1589 despite recording an 8.5% gain over the last seven days. 
Shiba Inu (SHIB) was comparatively stable, losing just 0.3% in the same timeframe. Pepe (PEPE), the 3rd largest meme token by market capitalization, dipped 0.9%, although it remains up 13.6% over the past week.
The trading volumes, however, suggest that interest remains concentrated around the top three assets, with Dogecoin posting nearly $1 billion in 24h volume. Still, risk appetite has clearly rotated toward Bitcoin dominance, leaving meme tokens temporarily sidelined. 
While the current defensive market has seen top memecoin lose traction on Monday, this trend may reverse sharply as investor sentiment improves. If Bitcoin price convincingly advances towards the $100,000 it could reignite memecoin rallies on speculative demand.
In stark contrast to its larger peers, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) surged 15% on the day, making it the top-trending meme asset by search volume and one of the most actively watched altcoins. 
Trading at $0.93 with a market cap of $924 million, Fartcoin’s spike appears to be driven by speculative interest and growing retail attention. 
Despite the market’s risk-off tone, Fartcoin outperformed all major tokens in the category and entered the top 100 by market cap. The project’s sudden virality and rapid price appreciation mirror early stages of previous meme coin cycles, where low market cap coins with strong retail engagement quickly attract liquidity once Bitcoin solidifies a breakout.
In terms of short-term price prediction, technical indicators on the Fartcoin 12-hour chart highlight the $0.15 resistance as the key level to watch for potential breakout signals 
Fartcoin price remains buoyant above the $0.91 level, with the 12-hour chart showing a sustained uptrend supported by rising VWAP and mid-band Bollinger support at $0.9188. Price action is hugging the upper Bollinger Band at $1.0618, suggesting strong momentum without overextension. 
Notably, the Parabolic SAR dots sit comfortably beneath the current price range, indicating bullish trend continuation and that the rally has not yet reached overbought exhaustion.
Fartcoin price prediction 
A closer look at the Bollinger Band width suggests volatility expansion, typically a precursor to significant price discovery phases. The Volume Delta today is neutral at 28.33K, signaling consolidation rather than distribution. If Bitcoin breaks $100K and meme coin flows resume, the next resistance lies near $1.06 — the upper Bollinger Band.
On the bearish side, failure to hold the VWAP and a break below $0.89 could see Fartcoin revisit the mid-range at $0.71, where the lower Bollinger Band converges. 
If Bitcoin price crosses the $100,000 market, Fartcoin could easily extend its rally past the $1.20 psychological mark, especially if new capital flows from sidelined retail investors looking for lower entry points.
Dogecoin price continues to consolidate around the $0.1600 level, finding immediate support near the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) at $0.15936. This stabilization is occurring within the Keltner Channel bands, suggesting a period of reduced volatility as traders skim prior gains.
The lower boundary of the Keltner Channel at $0.14369 remains a key support zone, while the upper bound near $0.17777 forms the next bullish target should momentum reaccelerate.
Dogecoin Price Forecast
If Bitcoin price breaches the psychological $100,000 level, Dogecoin is well-positioned to break above $0.1650 and test the upper resistance at $0.1750. A sustained close above that level would open the path toward $0.1950, driven by renewed meme coin enthusiasm.
However, failure to hold above VWAP could expose DOGE to a pullback toward $0.1500 and possibly the KC lower support at $0.14369. Until then, price action remains range-bound but biased higher, contingent on Bitcoin’s broader trend resolution.
Shiba Inu price is holding steady at $0.000012, consolidating just below the critical short-term resistance zone between $0.000011 and $0.000012, defined by the converging 5, 8, and 13-day SMAs on the 12-hourly SHIBUSDT chart. 
The bullish crossover observed last Friday, confirmed by the green arrow, signals short-term upside momentum, though the flattening slope of these moving averages hints at hesitation. 
Shiba Inu price prediction | SHIBUSDT
The MACD remains in positive territory, but its histogram is contracting, suggesting the bullish momentum may be stalling unless a catalyst—like Bitcoin breaking $100,000—reignites volume.
In this case, a decisive close above $0.000012 could validate the bullish structure, with upside targets set at the March high of $0.000016. 
Conversely, failure to hold above the $0.00001150 floor risks a bearish reversal back toward $0.00001050.

Bitcoin is back above $85,000, and BTC dominance is climbing towards its four-year peak. This may be the perfect time for altcoins with a high BTC correlation to rally during the bull run. Altcoin tokens with a real use case, growing adoption, and bullish on-chain and technical indicators could double or climb to three times their value this cycle.

Sui (SUI), the native token of a Layer 1 blockchain platform, XRP (XRP), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) are the top three picks for altcoins that could gain during this bull run. On Tuesday, April 15, SUI announced an expansion of an integration with Babylon Bitcoin staking protocol. As part of the integration, Bitcoin holders can secure the Sui network without giving up on their BTC holdings. 
The Bitcoin (BTC) staking protocol deepens its ties with the Layer 1 blockchain, as SUI prepares to lock step with BTC price trend. Bitcoin is hovering close to support at the $85,000 level, eyeing a return above the $90,000 resistance. 
SUI gained 5% in the last seven days, the token is up nearly 3% in the last six months, while the token is down 48% from its January 2025 peak of $5.3772. 
SUI has been in a downward trend since its January peak. SUI could gain 25% and test resistance at the upper boundary of a Fair Value Gap (FVG), at $2.6069. If SUI sees a daily candlestick close above this level and flips it into support, it faces resistance at R1, R2, and R3, the 50%, 100%, and 127.2% Fibonacci retracements of its decline from January top to April 2025 local bottom. 
R1 at $3.5473, R2 at $5.3772, and R3 at $6.3726 are the three key resistances. A rally to R3 marks 201.84% or greater than 3x gains for SUI. 
XRP, the native token of XRPLedger, was previously deemed a security in transactions involving institutions by the U.S. SEC. The end of the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit in a settlement, XRP ETF filings by asset management giants, and Ripple’s stablecoin launch are the key catalysts driving gains in the token in 2025. 
Bitcoin’s rally to its $100,000 milestone in December 2024 was accompanied by XRP’s run to the $3 target. Since then, XRP hit a peak of $3.40 on January 16, days ahead of Bitcoin’s new all-time high at $107,240. Bitcoin and the second-largest altcoin have recovered from flash crashes and steep market corrections previously, making the token a likely candidate for further gains this cycle. 
XRP could gain 18% and test resistance at the upper boundary of an FVG at $2.506, the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of its decline from its 2025 peak to cycle low. A 42% rally could push XRP to test resistance at the $3 milestone as seen in the chart below.

Fartcoin, a meme token built on the Solana blockchain, amassed over $834 million in market capitalization. The meme coin is trading close to key resistance at $0.9074, the 50% Fibonacci retracement of its decline from its peak of $1.6150 to the $0.1998 low. A 54% rally could push Fartcoin to test resistance at a key level, at $1.2911. The MACD signals the likelihood of further gains in the meme coin, and RSI reads 63, under the “overbought” level at 70. 
Bitcoin dominance is on its way to 64%, a four-year peak. This implies an altcoin season, or a period where 75% of the top 50 altcoins outperform Bitcoin in the 90-day timeframe, is likely to be delayed. However, traders can expect key altcoins that enjoy a high correlation with Bitcoin, higher utility, proven use case and traction among market participants to yield gains for holders. 
Cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and SOL-based meme tokens that have gained favor with institutional investors and whales could see a rise in inflows. This could catalyze gains in a handful of altcoins during the ongoing Bitcoin bull run. 
Social data from LunarCrush.com shows that the mention of “altcoin season” is down from its peak of 100% in January to 77% on April 15. This follows a wipeout of small retail traders and altcoin holders during the Bitcoin flash crashes since the November 2024 Presidential election result. 
Debates on whether there will be an altcoin season inevitably lead crypto traders to the question whether Bitcoin will reclaim its position alongside Gold as a “safe haven.” Gold’s climb has been significant, consistent and steady amidst global uncertainty. 
Traders looking for a safe haven to protect funds from market uncertainty have once again started looking to Gold, after nearly half a decade of Bitcoin’s popularity as a “safe haven.” It’s no longer about a piece of code vs. shiny metal, the debate runs deep amidst rising money supply, debt and the volatility of global markets. 
Between November 2022 and November 2024, Bitcoin and Gold enjoyed a relatively tight correlation. The metal gained 67% alongside Bitcoin’s 400% rally. While both assets were locked in the same direction, analysts expected the relationship to stay. Gold has maintained its status as a hedge against inflation, while Bitcoin falters, amidst Trump’s shifting tariff announcements, crypto-related executive orders and the relationship has frayed the most in 2025. 
As of late March, Gold gained another 16%, Bitcoin wiped out over 6% of its value, and closed its worst-performing first quarter of the year. It remains to be seen whether Bitcoin will regain its edge and feature in portfolios as an inflation hedge. 
Previous crypto market cycles have followed the four-year pattern, with a new Bitcoin all-time high and an altcoin season. The market cycle disruption in 2024 follows the rapid institutional adoption of Bitcoin and top cryptocurrencies, large volume capital flows, and the influence of whale participation in spot and derivative markets. 
As the U.S. takes steps towards cementing its Strategic Crypto Reserve and policy to amass Bitcoin, the institutionalization pushes deeper into the crypto ecosystem and threatens to disrupt four-year cycles. 
In a podcast with Galaxy, an analyst behind the X handle @_Checkmatey_ explained that the $70,000 to $75,000 range is a critical inflection point for Bitcoin, both psychologically and structurally. Bitcoin’s further price discovery this cycle depends on whether the range holds and how BTC price performs.

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, used to identify the sentiment among crypto market participants, reads 38 at the time of writing. This shows traders are in a bearish mood, however, the sentiment has improved between last month, last week and yesterday.
Extreme fear that gripped traders is eventually easing, and while market participants remain cautious, it is likely that investors will find their footing and “buy the dip,” or enter from the sidelines if Bitcoin continues to hold steady and hovers around key support at $85,000. 
James Toledano, COO at Unity Wallet told Crypto.news in an exclusive interview that U.S. recession fears have intensified, however it is likely that we may not have seen the bottom yet. Toledano said, 
“Despite these headwinds, Bitcoin is up over 25% over the past six months and is currently edging toward $86,000 although it appears to be shying away. Analysts argue that recessionary fears and global economic tensions may be driving more interest in decentralized assets like Bitcoin, but if a recession does hit and bites hard, will people want to speculate in volatile assets? 
It does however feel that Bitcoin’s appeal as a decentralized asset grows, especially as traditional markets face volatility. While Trump’s policies have introduced significant macroeconomic uncertainty, they may paradoxically be fueling Bitcoin’s recent rise — though the risks remain elevated for all markets, crypto included.”

        Share    
Bitcoin price has bounced back in the past few days, but an emerging risky pattern points to a potential reversal in the near term.
Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to $85,630 on April 15, its highest level in nearly two weeks and 15.2% above its monthly low.
The ongoing recovery happened after Donald Trump softened his stance on tariffs. He initially issued a 90-day pause on tariffs from over 70 countries.
Over the weekend, the Trump administration added that some electronics and semiconductors would be exempt from these levies. In his latest statement, Trump also pledged support for automakers navigating the ongoing tariff crisis.
This announcement contributed to further gains in the stock market, with futures tied to the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq 100 all trending higher.
While Bitcoin’s rebound is encouraging, it now faces the risk of forming a death cross — a bearish technical pattern that occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average.
The gap between these two averages has narrowed to just 472 points, signaling a potential crossover. If this happens, Bitcoin could resume its downward trend and potentially retest this month’s low of $74,500 — about 13% below current levels.
On the other hand, a breakout above both moving averages would invalidate the death cross and signal more upside, potentially pushing BTC toward the psychological level of $90,000.
Adding to the risk, the S&P 500 index has also formed a death cross, a signal that historically points to more downside. The last time this occurred was in 2022, when the index fell by 17%.
Since Bitcoin and equities are both considered risk-on assets, a bearish signal in the stock market could weigh further on Bitcoin’s price.
Meanwhile, gold continues to perform well as investors seek out safe-haven assets. The precious metal has surged more than 20% this year, reaching a record high of $3,245. Goldman Sachs recently raised its gold price target to $3,700.
The rally has been fueled by strong demand from central banks, retail investors, and institutions. Countries like India, Turkey, Russia, and China have continued accumulating gold throughout 2024.
Similarly, top gold ETFs like the GLD and IAU have also attracted more inflows from retail and institutions. Therefore, there are signs that investors prefer gold to American stocks, bonds, and Bitcoin for their safety. The Swiss franc has also become a top safe haven as it surged to the highest point in over a decade.

In the past week, XRP was at risk of adding a zero to its price and potentially dropping below the $1 mark due to an intense sell-off. Luckily for the asset, the crypto market is currently recovering, and the risk was effectively erased. At press time, XRP is changing hands at $2.18, up 2.31% over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap data, seeing a 12.11% increase over the past seven days. The fear of XRP's massive drop was heightened during a broader market crash; at the peak of the sell-off, XRP plunged to a monthly low of $1.64, with the asset's trading volume also experiencing a fall. However, trading volume has stabilized, indicating renewed interest in XRP. Additionally, growing hype around XRP ETFs and the potential involvement of major firms like BlackRock and Fidelity could further boost the asset's growth prospects.

Bitcoin (BTC) $85,800 Price Point: Here's What On-Chain Data Says
Tomiwabold Olajide



As announced by Strategy business intelligence firm on Monday, April 14, it has acquired additional 3,459 BTC worth $285 million at around $82,618 per coin. The purchase brought Strategy's total holdings to 531,644 BTC, with the company now accounting for 2.5% of the cryptocurrency's total supply (21 million). The Bitcoin community was anticipating this significant purchase following a teaser by Strategy's cofounder Michael Saylor on his X page. ""21M is the most important number in finance,"" wrote Saylor in his X post from April 12. Strategy's average purchase price for Bitcoin is nearing $68,000. Currently, Bitcoin's price is sitting slightly above $85,000; despite the size of Strategy's purchase, it had little impact on the flagship crypto's price.
Shiba Inu is gaining attention thanks to notable whale activity. Over the past two days, 160 billion tokens have flown into the asset. According to netflow data provided by IntoTheBlock, large holders are ramping up their accumulation after a period of stagnation, with netflows rising sharply to over 80 billion SHIB per day. This short-term shift suggests a possible turning point, even though netflows are still in negative territory over longer time periods. At the moment, SHIB is trading at about $0.000012, showing resilience by holding above key support levels, although it still lags behind important moving averages. The recent uptick in interest from both whales and smaller traders raises questions about potential price movements, but the overall lack of innovation in the SHIB ecosystem leaves its long-term recovery uncertain.

Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, fell to $83,600, extending the retreat from the two-week high of $86,440 reached earlier in the day, CoinDesk data showed. Payments-focused XRP followed a similar trajectory, falling over 2% to $2.08, while Cardano's ADA token slipped 4% to $0.61. The CoinDesk 20 Index, a broader market gauge, weakened over 2%.
Meanwhile, coins supposedly associated with artificial intelligence (AI) continued to fare worse as shares in NVDA tanked 8% to $89.10 after the company disclosed in a regulatory filing that it expects to write down $5.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter due to the new restrictions on exports of its H20 chip to China. 
The news came a day after unusual activity in NVDA put options pointing to an impending market swoon.
The futures tied to the Nasdaq index fell over 1% as well, offering negative cues to risk assets in general.
The next catalyst awaiting release Wednesday morning Eastern time is the U.S. retail sales report for March. Per economists polled by Dow Jones, the data is expected to show a 1.2% increase in consumer spending on the month, up from a 0.2% climb in February. 
A better-than-expected report will likely help assuage recession fears triggered by President Donald Trump's trade war with China and other trading partners. However, there is a risk that markets will dismiss it as backward-looking, failing to account for the major escalation in trade tensions seen this month.
Federal Reserve's Chairman Jerome Powell is also scheduled to speak on Wednesday at the Economic Club of Chicago on his outlook for the U.S. economy.
""All eyes are on Powell. Markets are holding their breath for Powell on Wednesday. Between the trade war and rising recession chatter, traders are watching for any hint the Fed might be forced to cut sooner than expected,"" Secure Digital Markets said in Tuesday's research note.
The forward-looking market-based measures like the inflation breakevens have dropped amid trade tensions, pointing to the disinflationary impact of Trump's tariffs. That could provide the Fed with a leeway to cut rates.
Early this week, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the bank would be forced to quickly make a series of ""bad news"" rate cuts if the U.S. president reimposes the levies unveiled on April 2. Trump announced sweeping tariffs on 180 nations on April 2 but quickly suspended the same for most nations, excluding China, for 90 days.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is stabilizing around $83,500 on Wednesday after it faced multiple rejections around its 200-day EMA at $85,000; a breakout indicates a bullish trend. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) extended their losses after facing resistance around their key levels.
Bitcoin has faced multiple rejections around its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $85,000 since Sunday. On Tuesday, BTC tried breaking above this level but was rejected again and declined by 1.12%. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it hovers around $83,500.
If BTC closes above $85,000 on a daily basis, it could extend the rally to the key psychological level of $90,000. A successful close above this level could extend an additional rally to test its March 2 high of $95,000.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart flattens around its neutral level of 50, indicating indecisiveness among traders. The RSI must move above its neutral level for the bullish momentum to be sustained.
BTC/USDT daily chart
However, if BTC continues its downward trend, it could extend the decline to retest its next daily support level at $78,258.
Ethereum price found support around its daily level of $1,449 last week and recovered slightly, but it faced resistance of around $1,700. On Monday, ETH was again rejected around this level and declined by 2.15% the next day. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it hovers around $1,590.
If ETH continues its correction, it could extend the losses to retest its daily support level at $1,449. A successful close below this level could extend an additional decline to retest its important psychological level of $1,300.
The RSI on the daily chart hovers at 40 below its neutral level of 50, indicating bearish momentum.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.
Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 
Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

The cryptocurrency aggregate market capitalization stabilized around $2.7 trillion on Wednesday, with Bitcoin’s $84,000 support momentarily anchoring the market against external bearish discourses.
Nvidia stock price dipped 5% on Wednesday, experiencing major sell-offs on Wednesday following a $5.5 billion charge resulting from a US government ban on its H20 chip sales to China. 
Initial market reactions suggest BTC appears to benefit from displaced capital as traders exit NVDA and adjacent US tech stocks to mitigate the impact of trade war. 
Bitcoin price action, April 16 | Coingecko
With Bitcoin viewed as resistant to global trade and supply chain risks, BTC could potentially approach $85,000 as the day unfolds if traders continue to rotate funds from stocks into crypto.
On the flipside, considering Nvidia’s systemic importance to crypto mining equipment, if the NVDA sell-off intensifies, it could eventually spread bearish headwinds toward BTC markets, potentially knocking prices closer to $80,000.
The altcoin market reflects growing risk aversion, with traders gravitating toward assets linked to stability and high utility.
Despite its dominant smart contract presence, Ethereum price has plunged below the $1,600 support, dropping 3.1% over the past 24 hours, amid broader fears of declining DeFi activity.
Meanwhile, Tron has surged by 2.3%, becoming the only top-10 crypto to post a daily gain, signaling a different kind of market response.
Crypto Market Performance, April 16, 2025 | Source: Coingecko
Tron's price gains stand out not just for its price action but for what it represents: heightened on-chain activity driven by stablecoin transactions. 
As a dominant player in the stablecoin sector, especially for USDT on-chain volume, Tron's rise signals increased demand for low-cost, high-throughput transfers. 
This often correlates with rising trading volume and capital flight, as investors and exchanges use Tron’s cheap fees to park funds in stablecoins during volatile market periods.
Hence, the mild uptick in Tron also reflects a defensive stance by the market, favoring networks that enable the efficient movement of capital. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s decline suggests some traders are rotating out of high-fee Layer 1 protocols, opting instead for practical utility and transaction efficiency, especially during trade war-driven volatility
Metaplanet has issued its 11th series of ordinary bonds, totaling $10 million, to EVO FUND. The bonds carry no interest and are part of the company’s ongoing strategy to increase its Bitcoin reserves. The funds from this bond issuance will be used exclusively to acquire additional Bitcoin, aligning with plans previously disclosed by Metaplanet in January 2025.
The zero-interest bonds are set to mature on October 14, 2025. Metaplanet confirmed that redemption of these bonds will be financed through proceeds from its 14th to 17th Series of Stock Acquisition Rights. 
Coinbase Institutional has released a report citing several bearish signals pointing to a potential onset of a new crypto winter. The firm noted a significant decline in total crypto market capitalization, excluding Bitcoin, alongside a slowdown in venture capital funding in Q1 2025.
The report also emphasized that both Bitcoin and the COIN50 index have dipped below their 200-day moving averages.
DWF Labs has announced a $25 million investment in governance tokens of World Liberty Financial, a digital finance platform backed by Donald Trump. The investment aligns with the firm’s broader strategy to support emerging DeFi projects, including the USD1 stablecoin initiative, which is part of the expanding digital asset ecosystem.
As part of its US expansion, DWF Labs is opening a new office in New York City. The firm stated that the move will help foster regulatory engagement, attract local talent, and strengthen partnerships within the American crypto market.

 For many years after its inception bitcoin was seen as an investment that traded unlike traditional assets, but as its tumble in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement shows, these days it’s trading much like any other risky investment.Bitcoin fell sharply in the wake of Trump’s tariff announcement on April 2, collapsing from $84,600 to $75,000 within a week. That plunge extended declines that began in February. On Jan. 30, bitcoin was worth over $106,000 after a blistering postelection rally.This drop coincided with a selloff in US stocks, especially technology stocks. During the week following Trump’s announcement on tariffs, bitcoin shed 10.5%, very close to the 11.6% lost by the S&P 500 and 12% by the Nasdaq 100.“Bitcoin’s heightened correlation with the Nasdaq and S&P 500 reflects its evolving role as a macro-sensitive asset, driven by institutional behavior and policy shifts,” says Adrian Fritz, head of research at 21Shares, a specialized provider of crypto ETPs.“Institutional investors now treat bitcoin similarly to tech stocks, creating synchronized trading patterns during macroeconomic events. This alignment intensified under Trump’s pro-crypto agenda,” he adds.“Bitcoin might be decentralized, but it does not trade in a vacuum—when macro fear spikes, it gets hit like everything else,” says WisdomTree’s digital assets research director Dovile Silenskyte.Trump’s Tariffs and BitcoinTrump’s promises to make the United States the new “bitcoin hub” attracted institutional capital, but they also bound bitcoin to political risks impacting traditional markets. Fritz says that over the past quarter, this evolving relationship solidified bitcoin’s status as a risk-on asset. Thus, when the tariffs sparked a global flight to safety, investors rapidly exited both equities and bitcoin, triggering parallel 15% declines in BTC, the Nasdaq, and the S&P 500 as capital mainly rotated into the much relatively safer haven, like gold.At the same time, when news broke of a 90-day suspension of the tariffs and suddenly the risk-on sentiment came roaring back, bitcoin surged in line with a rally across equities. On April 9, BTC gained 8.2%, while the S&P 500 rallied 9.5%. “This rebound was not about crypto fundamentals, it was a classic macro-driven relief rally, showing just how plugged-in bitcoin is to the broader market narrative,” says WisdomTree’s Silenskyte. For Ferdinando Ametrano, managing director of CheckSig and a professor of Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology at Milan-Bicocca University, “bitcoin is a thermometer of globalization, sensitive to international scenarios.” “One part of the market likens it to North American tech stocks; another part sees it as digital gold, a safe haven asset.” Who is right will become clearer in the future, he says, but as of today in the tensest moments the association with equities typical of the most active market participants prevails, because the other component has instead a buy-and-hold approach.Bitcoin Much Less Volatile Than in The PastDespite the swings seen in bitcoin recently, some point to data suggesting that the cryptocurrency has become less volatile.“Over the past five years, bitcoin’s 90-day annualized volatility has been cut nearly in half—from 95% in March 2021 to 52% in March 2025,” says Silenskyte.What’s driving this shift?“Bitcoin has undergone a structural shift toward institutionalization,” says Silenskyte.“Bitcoin has entered a phase of accelerated institutionalization, marked by growing participation from professional asset managers and corporate treasuries,” says 21Shares’ Fritz. “This shift is driven by the development of regulated financial instruments such as spot bitcoin ETFs, options contracts, and volatility-linked derivatives, which enable sophisticated strategies like basis trading and risk-hedged exposure.”Major financial institutions now allocate portions of their portfolios to digital assets. Such institutional footprint has gradually displaced retail-driven speculation, fostering a “market structure with tighter bid-ask spreads and reduced gap risks compared with previous cycles” and concurrently “reduced bitcoin’s historical volatility.”Max Shannon, research analyst at CoinShares, also says that “bitcoin’s status as a 24/7 traded asset means it consistently attracts liquidity, contributing to deeper market structures.” As institutional participation grows and market infrastructure matures, “this increased depth is gradually helping to reduce the asset’s historical volatility.”What To Expect From Bitcoin Prices Now?Trump is the first openly pro-crypto US president, and his second term is expected to usher in a friendlier policy environment for crypto markets, but that doesn’t mean it will all be plain sailing from here.“Investors should expect both volatility and opportunity,” says Silenskyte, who adds that “macro liquidity remains the single most powerful force in markets and bitcoin is no exception.” Beyond the introduction of favorable regulations for crypto assets in the US, the opening of the European market, made possible by the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation bill, “will facilitate the entry of new institutional investors” such as when BlackRock and Fidelity launched ETFs, says CheckSig’s Ametrano.Ametrano thinks that bitcoin can reach new records in the next 12 to 18 months, and that “it will consolidate its role in diversified wallets.” But he adds that “price fluctuations will be inevitable.”The author or authors do own shares in any securities mentioned in this article.

The Morningstar Star Rating for Stocks is assigned based on an analyst's estimate of a stocks fair value. It is projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Morningstar assigns star ratings based on an analyst’s estimate of a stock's fair value. Four components drive the Star Rating: (1) our assessment of the firm’s economic moat, (2) our estimate of the stock’s fair value, (3) our uncertainty around that fair value estimate and (4) the current market price. This process culminates in a single-point star rating that is updated daily. A 5-star represents a belief that the stock is a good value at its current price; a 1-star stock isn't. If our base-case assumptions are true the market price will converge on our fair value estimate over time, generally within three years. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance.

Quantitative Fair Value Estimate represents Morningstar’s estimate of the per share dollar amount that a company’s equity is worth today. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is based on a statistical model derived from the Fair Value Estimate Morningstar’s equity analysts assign to companies which includes a financial forecast of the company. The Quantitative Fair Value Estimate is calculated daily. It is a projection/opinion and not a statement of fact. Investments in securities are subject to market and other risks. Past performance of a security may or may not be sustained in future and is no indication of future performance. For detail information about the Quantiative Fair Value Estimate, please visit here
The Morningstar Medalist Rating is the summary expression of Morningstar’s forward-looking analysis of investment strategies as offered via specific vehicles using a rating scale of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. The Medalist Ratings indicate which investments Morningstar believes are likely to outperform a relevant index or peer group average on a risk-adjusted basis over time. Investment products are evaluated on three key pillars (People, Parent, and Process) which, when coupled with a fee assessment, forms the basis for Morningstar’s conviction in those products’ investment merits and determines the Medalist Rating they’re assigned. Pillar ratings take the form of Low, Below Average, Average, Above Average, and High. Pillars may be evaluated via an analyst’s qualitative assessment (either directly to a vehicle the analyst covers or indirectly when the pillar ratings of a covered vehicle are mapped to a related uncovered vehicle) or using algorithmic techniques. Vehicles are sorted by their expected performance into rating groups defined by their Morningstar Category and their active or passive status. When analysts directly cover a vehicle, they assign the three pillar ratings based on their qualitative assessment, subject to the oversight of the Analyst Rating Committee, and monitor and reevaluate them at least every 14 months. When the vehicles are covered either indirectly by analysts or by algorithm, the ratings are assigned monthly. For more detailed information about these ratings, including their methodology, please go to here
The Morningstar Medalist Ratings are not statements of fact, nor are they credit or risk ratings. The Morningstar Medalist Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating an investment product, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what was expected, (iii) are not guaranteed to be based on complete or accurate assumptions or models when determined algorithmically, (iv) involve the risk that the return target will not be met due to such things as unforeseen changes in changes in management, technology, economic development, interest rate development, operating and/or material costs, competitive pressure, supervisory law, exchange rate, tax rates, exchange rate changes, and/or changes in political and social conditions, and (v) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the investment product. A change in the fundamental factors underlying the Morningstar Medalist Rating can mean that the rating is subsequently no longer accurate.

Panama City Council approves using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum to pay municipal taxes, permits, tickets, and fees. 
According to a report from Panama Banking News, the approval authorizes Panama’s Mayor Mayer Mizrachi to formalize a deal with Towertrust. Inc. and Towerbank International Inc. 
Under the partnership, Panama citizens can pay their municipal taxes, fees, tickets, and permits using various cryptocurrencies via an escrow-like system. Mizrachi confirmed the development in a statement yesterday, noting that the system will initially support four cryptocurrencies: ETH, BTC, USDT, and USDC. 
He suggested that the move positions Panama City Council as the first public government institution to accept crypto payments for taxes and fees. 
Mizrachi recounted how the previous administration attempted to approve crypto’s use for tax payments via new legislation. However, his administration found a way to achieve the feat without submitting new legislation to the Senate. 
He emphasized that since public institutions are already structured to receive payments in U.S. dollars, the administration partnered with a bank to facilitate the conversion. Through this partnership, the bank will immediately convert received cryptocurrency payments into U.S. dollars.
Mizrachi expects the new initiative to maintain the free flow of cryptocurrencies throughout the Panama City economy. 
🇵🇦 Panama City council has just voted in favor of becoming the first public institution of government to accept payments in Crypto. 
Citizens will now be able to pay taxes, fees, tickets and permits entirely in crypto starting with BTC, ETH, USDC, USDT@APompliano @aantonop…
— Mayer Mizrachi (@Mayer) April 15, 2025

It is worth mentioning that paying taxes with crypto is voluntary. Therefore, residents can decide whether to use crypto assets or traditional methods. 
In addition, Panama City’s support of crypto payments will not incur additional costs for the Mayor’s Office and will not alter existing tax regimes. Following the support of crypto payments, Panama’s citizens can meet their tax obligations from anywhere in the world. 
It is also expected to enhance the city’s transparency in financial processes while also contributing to the modernization of its payment system. Moreover, it could prompt other government institutions to accept crypto payments for taxes and fees. 
The use of crypto to pay taxes and other fees is becoming popular. Several cities and states, particularly the United States, already accept crypto payments for these services. 
For instance, Colorado accepted crypto payments in 2022, allowing its residents to pay taxes using the emerging asset. However, the crypto payment system did not record much success in the early phase. 
Only six crypto tax payments were recorded from September to mid-December 2022, a negligible figure compared to the 1.37 million tax payment transactions recorded during the same period. 
Further, other states like Louisiana and Utah, as well as cities like South Dakota and Detroit, also accept cryptocurrencies for tax payments.

Bitcoin Struggles at Resistance as Bearish Divergences Mount
Bitcoin pierced overhead resistance and set a slightly higher local high above $86,000 but failed to hold the level, quickly falling back to the bottom of the daily TBO Cloud. Despite BTC remaining inside the Cloud—a generally bullish zone—momentum appears to be fading. Daily volume has slipped below the 30-day moving average, and although OBV is still trending above its moving average, signaling underlying strength, the price action is showing hesitation.
The daily RSI printed a lower high, suggesting weakening momentum. Meanwhile, two fresh TBT Bearish Divergence signals have appeared on the 4-hour chart, mimicking the bearish setup seen in late April before BTC dropped from $88,000 to $74,000. A repeat of that dramatic move is unlikely, but these warnings point to a possible pullback to the $80,000 range.

Market-Wide Divergences and Weakness in Altcoins Raise Concern
Stablecoin dominance rose slightly and closed above the daily TBO Cloud, with a short-term target at 8.22%. A rise to that level would likely coincide with a broader pullback across the crypto market. Bitcoin dominance remains elevated, defying bearish divergence seen between price and RSI on the daily chart. This divergence suggests eventual weakness, yet BTC.D continues to push higher.
Top 10 Dominance closed below the TBO Cloud but is showing strength through higher lows on RSI. OTHERS.D, on the other hand, is nearing its April 7th low. Even though it printed a higher low on RSI yesterday, the chart remains firmly bearish. TOTAL has maintained its structure inside the TBO Cloud, and OBV continues to trend higher, but two TBT Bearish Divergences on its 4-hour chart mirror the BTC setup and suggest caution.
The broader altcoin market remains vulnerable. OTHERS is still strong bearish, and although OBV is holding key support, the lack of a relief rally—despite falling BVOL7D—indicates how dependent ALTs are on Bitcoin's slow grind upward. Without BTC leading, low-cap coins and OTHERS will likely continue chopping lower.
Altcoin Setups Turning Bearish Amid BTC Uncertainty
SOL continues to hold inside the daily TBO Cloud and above the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level, but a pair of recent TBT Bearish Divergences on the 4-hour chart suggest a possible move down to $110. This would also close the open CME gap at $121. AVAX recently printed a bearish divergence cluster, with downside targets around $15 aligning with TBO Support.
OM rallied back to its 1.0 Fibonacci retracement level, but remains highly vulnerable to another pullback. HYPE triggered two bearish divergence signals on the 4-hour just below TBO Support, and XMR has climbed back above the daily TBO Cloud after last week's steep drop, showing unexpected resilience.
RENDER is signaling a likely reversal, with bearish divergence and a TBO Close Long in progress on the 4-hour just below resistance. IP followed with its first 4-hour TBO Close Short yesterday, and WIF was rejected at overhead resistance, targeting a move back down to 0.304.
Some Bright Spots Persist, but Caution Is Advised
CORE is a standout performer, now printing a TBO Open Long on the daily chart. Strong OBV and RSI back the bullish continuation, making this a solid DCA Bot candidate. RAY is climbing inside the daily TBO Cloud but faces conflicting signals, with bearish divergence on the 4-hour even as it tests TBO Resistance. GRASS is consolidating tightly; a breakout above local resistance could spark a strong move toward $2.
PENDLE remains bullish overall and is in a TBO Open Long, but weakening volume and flattening OBV raise concerns about a short-term drop to the bottom of the TBO Cloud before another push higher. SPX appears to be retracing to 4-hour TBO Support, and FARTCOIN has now printed three bearish divergence signals below its 4-hour TBO Resistance. Despite strong bullish trends earlier, momentum is waning. A small short produced solid returns, and with BTC looking shaky, FARTCOIN could be vulnerable to a larger move down.
Final Thoughts
The confluence of bearish divergence signals across Bitcoin, TOTAL, and many altcoins is a clear warning that a short-term correction may be underway. BTC's failure to hold above $86,000 and the sharp rise in 4-hour divergence signals point to a potential retest of lower support levels. Altcoins remain fragile and continue to overreact, following Bitcoin's lead due to the Multiple Factor Effect.
Until BTC can reclaim and close above overhead resistance with strong volume, expect volatility and downside risk to dominate the short term.

On Mar. 6, 2025, an executive order set up the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The order prohibits the government from selling bitcoins or buying more using taxpayers’ money. Since then, it has been unclear how the U.S. is going to acquire more bitcoins, although several options have been named. 
In a recent interview with Professional Capital Management CEO Anthony Pompliano, the President of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, Bo Hines mentioned two methods that were actively discussed by the officials. Let’s dive deeper into what he said and name other ideas on how the U.S. could acquire more bitcoins.

A video clip of Hines’ interview with Pompliano emerged on the Internet on Apr. 14, 2025. In the clip, Hines mentions two legitimate avenues for the U.S. to increase its bitcoin holdings.
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF TRUMP'S COUNCIL OF ADVISORS ON DIGITAL ASSETS BO HINES SAYS THE U.S. COULD USE REVENUE FROM TARIFFS TO BUY $BTC pic.twitter.com/jo1MJf3NQ7
Hines began by mentioning the Bitcoin Act introduced by Senator Cynthia Lummis. He said that the act “has taken the community by storm.” He added that “that’s currently circulating its way through Capitol Hill” and that the supporters are looking for co-sponsors to help the act come to fruition. 
Sen. Lummis and Rep. Nick Begich introduced the Bitcoin Act on Mar. 11. The act enables the U.S. to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve similar to the gold reserves and formally recognize Bitcoin as a strategic national asset. The act suggests that the U.S. must acquire one million bitcoins in five years using budget-neutral ways, including Federal Reserve remittances and gold certificate revaluations.
In an interview, Hines emphasized the latter way of increasing the national BTC holdings. He explains that currently, most of the gold certificates in the U.S. Treasury are valued at $43 per ounce, while the current gold price exceeds $3,000. The Treasury Secretary may issue new certificates that reflect the fair market value of gold, not just a statutory price of gold certificates. Hines says that the U.S. can use “that extra funding” to buy more BTC. 
The actual statutory gold certificate price is set at $42.2 per troy ounce. Craig Hemke of Sprott Money has been critical of the gold revaluation strategy, dismissing it as an “accounting gimmick that enables the U.S. Treasury to create a trillion dollars from nothing while not impacting the net deficit of the current balance sheet.” Hemke noted that by adding $1 trillion to the asset side while simultaneously adding $1 trillion to the liabilities side, the only result is the dollar devaluation, driving the gold price higher.
However, a weak dollar is something Trump needs, so the U.S. may boost exports and bring back manufacturers from abroad. More than that, inflation usually results in a stronger Bitcoin performance. Given that, the gold certificate revaluation may result in exactly what the current administration aims for, even aside from finding money to buy Bitcoin.
The gold certificates revaluation isn’t the only way to fund the SBR. Hines mentioned one more method that wasn’t outlined before, the revenue from tariffs. According to research by the Tax Foundation, a 10% universal tariff may bring $2.2 trillion in nine years, while a 20% tariff would raise $3.4 trillion during the same period. The negative macroeconomic feedback may decrease these figures. 
Acquiring one million bitcoins at the current price takes much less than one trillion dollars. So, both the revenue from tariffs and the gold certificate revaluation seem to be efficient enough. These two methods are not the only. Hines admits there are countless possible ways to grow the SBR without spending taxpayers’ money. 
“Everything’s on the table. And like we’ve said, we want as much as we can get. So we’re going to make sure that no stone is unturned as we start fleshing out some of these processes.”
Other options brought up by various experts include establishing Bitcoin bonds and using the Exchange Stabilization Fund surplus to buy BTC.
Selling surplus from Exchange Stabilization Fund and Special Drawing Rights, which is an accounting maneuver similar to gold certificate revaluation. Selling this surplus doesn’t need Congress’s approval. It may give the government between $39 and $40 billion to spend on Bitcoin without much hassle.
Bitcoin Policy Institute introduced Bitcoin bonds, or BitBonds. Investors will have a fixed 1% annual interest paid in USD. 90% of the money obtained via BitBonds sales will fund the government, while the rest of the money may be used to buy more bitcoins for the SBR.
The approximately 200,000 BTC stockpile existing in the U.S. now consists of bitcoins collected through seizures. Accounting of bitcoins held by the U.S. agencies should have been done within 30 days after the adoption of the SBR on Mar. 6, 2025. However, it is still unknown if the audit took place and what the results are. 
Sure. The interview was comfort food if you are a crypto lobbyist. Bo broadly supported all the things crypto lobbyists want, even if it was light on actual specifics.The reason why I'm souring so hard on this interview in particular because this wasn't just a regular Pomp…
Pompliano has been criticized online for not bringing up the audit issue during the White House interview with Bo Hines, with some dismissing Pompliano as a Trump administration shill.

Huge institutional inflows coupled with a drop in exchange reserves show that Bitcoin’s price holds greater value when compared to previous cycles. The asset’s profit supply and projected growth also point upwards, with bulls hinting at new targets. 
After the crypto market recovery, Bitcoin bulls have stretched exchange withdrawals pushing up trader confidence. A digital asset expert Boris Vest noted that exchange reserves have plummeted to 2018 levels showing positions of long-term holdings. At the moment, about 2.43 million BTC are held on exchanges with older assets of seven days being moved to other custodians.
In the 2021 bull cycle, BTC exchange reserves stood at 3.4 million assets. The wide reduction in present figures points to an undervalued asset in light of recent headwinds. According to Vest, the decrease in supply correlates with a potential price jump. Crypto whales have also accumulated huge amounts of assets and transferred the same out of exchanges. 
Furthermore, the stablecoin supply ratio at 14.3 shows the growing capital available to purchase more assets. In the event of a price drop, the SSR still points upwards and hasn’t tapped the 2021 bull cycle levels, suggesting the top crypto is still undervalued.
“The funding rate had significantly increased alongside a momentum-driven price rise. This indicated that long positions on Bitcoin had become overly inflated and that buying pressure was too high—presenting a good selling opportunity for market makers. Following the ATH, funding rates saw a pullback and are now quite low, around 0.01–0.00. If this rate turns negative, it would signal an increase in short positions and potential upward price pressure.”
At press time, Bitcoin trades at $83,783, sliding 0.5% today although weekly gains are over 9%. Several factors have led to traders raising the odds for an uphill drive this quarter. A rebound in institutional demand tops trader’s list backed up by previous projections. 
Digital asset analytics firm CryptoQuant wrote that Bitcoin’s supply in profit above 70% places the price range in a stable position. However, the next target for long-term holders is the 80% range already marking heightened bullish momentum.

""The 200DMA model on bitcoin does suggest that the token’s recent steep decline qualifies this as a bear market cycle starting in late March. But the same exercise performed on the COIN50 index (which includes the top 50 tokens by market capitalization) shows the asset class as a whole has been unequivocally trading in bear market territory since the end of February,"" David Duong, global head of research at Coinbase Institutional, said in a note published Monday.
Bitcoin slipped below its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) on March 9 and has since established a foothold below the same in a sign of a long-term bearish shift in momentum. The 200-day SMA is widely tracked to gauge long-term trends, with persistent moves above the same, representing a bull market and vice versa.
Duong noted this observation while addressing the challenges of identifying a crypto bear market, where 20% or more corrections are routine. In contrast, a 20% decline is typically used to define bear markets in stock markets.
The report argued that the arbitrary 20% often fails to account for a dent in investor sentiment and resulting portfolio adjustments spurred by smaller, more intense sell-offs.
""We’ve seen in the past that sentiment-driven declines can often trigger defensive portfolio adjustments, despite not meeting the arbitrary 20% threshold. In other words, we believe that bear markets fundamentally represent regime shifts in market structure – characterized by deteriorating fundamentals and shrinking liquidity – rather than just their percentage declines,"" Duong noted.
In addition to the 200-day SMA, Duong highlighted bitcoin's risk-adjusted performance measured in standard deviations (z-score) relative to the average performance over the previous 365 days as another effective method for identifying crypto bear markets.
""Our [z-score] model indicates that the most recent bull cycle ended in late February. But it has since classified all subsequent activity as ""neutral,"" highlighting its potential lag in rapidly changing market dynamics,"" Duong said, calling for a defensive stance on risk asses for the time being. 
The impending winter may be more brutal for alternative cryptocurrencies considering the slowdown in the venture capital (VC) funding. 
While BTC set new highs early this year, well above the 2021 top of $70K, the bullish trend failed to inspire more risk taking in the VC space, leaving the overall funding 50%-60% below 2021-22 levels.
Duong said that the crypto market ""may find a floor in mid-to-late 2Q25 – setting up a better 3Q25.""

Overall crypto market capitalization fell 3.3% in the past 24 hours, with BTC sliding to nearly $83,500 from a high above $84,200 a day earlier. Ether (ETH) and Cardano’s ADA fell as much as 5% to lead losses among majors. 
XRP showed steady declines, with price action suggesting a plunge in the coming days. Fundamentals showed a positive bump, however, with exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider ProShares amending its spot XRP ETF (to be offered in the U.S.) filing on Tuesday — targeting a launch date of April 30.
Bitcoin selling by large investors has eased as they realize losses, on-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant shared in a note to CoinDesk. Daily bitcoin selling from large investors has declined from a high of 800,000 BTC in late February to a daily rate of about 300,000 BTC.
“The slowdown in selling has come as these investors have been realizing losses since late February amid low prices,” analysts wrote. “However, accumulation by large investors remains weak. Their holdings declined by approximately 30K BTC over the past week, and their monthly accumulation rate dropped from 2.7% at the end of March to just 0.5%—its slowest pace since February 20.”
A slump in majors came as Chinese stocks in Hong Kong extended their losses to as much as 2.9% after Wednesday’s open despite the Chinese economy growing 5.4% in the first quarter.
The extent of tariff impact remains a concern among traders, whose risk-off moves eventually weigh down crypto markets.
""There can be no doubt that fears of a U.S. recession are intensifying, with major institutions revising their forecasts sharply upwards,” James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet, told CoinDesk in an email. “Economic growth is forecast to stall at anywhere between 0.1% and 1%, and many believe these risks are already priced into equities, but I am not so sure that we’ve even seen the bottom.”
“It does however feel that Bitcoin’s appeal as a decentralized asset grows, especially as traditional markets face volatility. While Trump’s policies have introduced significant macroeconomic uncertainty, they may paradoxically be fueling Bitcoin’s recent rise—though the risks remain elevated for all markets, crypto included,” Toledano added.

This follows a string of whale purchases in the last 48 hours as crypto prices gain traction. Several crypto analysts have reiterated that the bull run is still in play despite major headwinds sending digital asset prices to multi-month lows.
Bitcoin whale activity spiked in the past week after a turnaround in sentiments. Crypto analytics firm Lookonchain revealed on X that a whale moved $315 million worth of Bitcoin from Kraken. This occurred after the price sniffed the $85k mark before recording a slight correction. 
From last week’s lows, BTC whales have gained confidence with the price at $84,343 soaring over 9% in the same period. Sharp price growth is often a spark for massive market activity as traders look ahead to the next bull run. Although transfers out of centralized exchanges are surging, most whales bought the dip days after President Trump announced his 90-day tariff reversal.
It should be noted that transfers out of exchanges and reduced reserves highlight long-term holdings while inflows to exchanges flash signs of an imminent sale. Initial community reaction to the 3,704 BTC purchase was bullish with the market leader soaring in hourly trading data. 
Another whale withdrew 2,372 BTC worth about $201 million from Binance and Kraken. The whale holds 16,780 BTC showing huge institutional participation in the market. According to Whale Alert, a crypto whale picked up 1,000 BTC (worth $84 million) today adding to the string of huge purchases. Inflows in Bitcoin triggered a similar reaction for altcoins. Over the past week, XRP and Solana (SOL) notched increased institutional investment. 
The majority of crypto holders project increased whale participation in the coming months. This is hinged on positive on-chain factors as well as rising institutional demand. The White House positive crypto agenda has set the tone for institutional appetite and developer innovation in the country. At the moment, Bitcoin has recorded huge recoveries from massive whale activities. 
The exchange whale ratio when compared to previous levels reignites trader optimism as bulls set their sights on the short-term $90k mark. As whales move assets off centralized exchanges, other participants have increased their market exposure.

Bitcoin price is steady, with a 7.85% weekly rise to $84,858.95, but its $1.68 trillion market cap is being overshadowed by altcoins stealing the spotlight.

            Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only.        
PEPE (PEPE), Minotaurus (MTAUR), and Ripple (XRP) have surged, with PEPE leading at 13.25%, followed by XRP’s 12.38%, outpacing Bitcoin’s (BTC) climb. 
These three cryptocurrencies, driven by technical breakouts and ecosystem growth, are capturing attention.  Here’s why they’re shining brighter than Bitcoin.
PEPE, trading at $0.057405 with an approximate $3 billion market cap, posted a 13.25% weekly surge and now ranks as the 30th most valuable crypto by market cap. Crypto analyst Crypto Kartha notes a confirmed breakout from a descending channel, projecting a 180% rally to $0.00002129. 
World Of Charts supports this view, citing a prior 142% jump after a similar breakout in October 2024, and expecting a comparable 117% move in April 2025.
PEPE’s appeal lies in its meme-driven community, amplified by Gen Z’s social media buzz. Unlike Bitcoin’s institutional lean, PEPE thrives on retail enthusiasm, making it a volatile but captivating altcoin as market sentiment shifts.
Minotaurus (MTAUR) is gaining traction in the Web3 gaming space, offering a strategy-based maze-running game that resonates with younger audiences. The token enables players to access exclusive features and power-ups, embedding blockchain utility in casual gaming which is a $15 billion market.
Influencers in crypto and gaming circles are spotlighting MTAUR, drawn to its community focus over hype. As altcoins like PEPE surge, MTAUR’s practical ecosystem positions it to catch the wave, especially if Bitcoin’s 61% dominance eases, sparking broader altcoin interest in 2025. Hurry up and buy Minotaurus here.
XRP, priced at $2.15 with a $125.43 billion market cap, climbed 12.38% this week, ranking on CoinMarketCap. Ripple’s euro-backed stablecoin launch on the XRP Ledger enhances its payment-focused blockchain, settling transactions in 3-5 seconds for $0.0002. 
Ali Martinez, a popular analyst, flags an ascending triangle, with a breakout past $2.22 eyeing $2.40. Another anonymous analyst pointed to a double bottom pattern and predicted a rally to a $17.
Bitcoin’s rally, backed by whale accumulation – 100,000 BTC since March per CryptoQuant – sets a bullish tone, but altcoins are stealing momentum. 
PEPE’s meme-fueled breakout, MTAUR’s gaming utility, and XRP’s stablecoin and technical patterns align with a potential altcoin season.

        Share    
Bloomberg’s editorial board has warned of a potential financial crisis similar to what happened in 2008/9 happening this year as geopolitical risks rise. 
In an article, the board warned that such a crisis could be triggered by the substantial sums of money held in the debt market. As business and consumer confidence fall and recession risks grow, they argued that lenders may begin demanding more cash collateral.
The board also warned that the US was highly leveraged, with the public debt soaring to over $36.8 trillion. Total corporate debt has jumped to a record high of over $13.7 trillion, while households hold over $18 trillion.
Bloomberg warns that banks and other lenders lack the resources to absorb these potential losses. The concern is that the next financial crisis could be worse than those that occurred during the pandemic and the 2008 financial meltdown.
This warning comes as the U.S. has alienated itself from allies by imposing tariffs. It has even raised tariffs on goods from China to 145%, increasing the risk of a recession. Polymarket traders currently put the odds of a recession this year at 65%.
A recession or a financial crisis would hurt Bitcoin (BTC), altcoins, and the stock market initially as the fear rises. It would also lead to a higher unemployment rate in the economy.
However, history shows these risk assets often perform well after major crises due to Federal Reserve and government interventions. The Fed slashed interest rates to zero during both the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. It then implemented quantitative easing, printed money, and injected liquidity into the economy.
In parallel, the federal government provided a $700 billion bailout to banks during the GFC and issued trillions in stimulus checks during the pandemic. These actions helped trigger a strong rally in both stocks and cryptocurrencies.
U.S. indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 entered bull markets after the GFC. Similarly, Bitcoin, altcoins, and equities soared following the COVID-era interventions, before retreating when the Fed began hiking rates in 2022.

Bitcoin’s price journey in 2025 is anything but boring. After rebounding to hover around $84,530.70, BTC continues to defy gravity while pushing technical indicators back into bullish territory. Momentum picked up following a crossover in the MACD signal line, and short-term strength is emerging despite the price remaining below the 200-day moving average. Forecasts from AI-driven models peg Bitcoin’s potential high for the year at over $143,000, with a low near $77,000. That range alone is a major conversation starter for serious capital allocators.
Bittensor TAO, meanwhile, has shown wild swings in just the last few sessions—dropping 17% to $183, then bouncing right back with double-digit gains. Fueled by macro triggers like tariff pauses and trend reversals around the 20-day SMA, TAO is currently trading at $242 after reaching $254 on Friday. Buyers have clearly returned to the arena, and the chart shows a battle zone of support and resistance right around the $240–$250 range. It’s a coin with undeniable volatility—but also undeniable attention.
And then there’s Qubetics—a completely different animal. While Bitcoin and TAO thrive off market reactions and short-term sentiment, Qubetics is steadily engineering something deeper. It isn’t here to compete with hype coins. It’s here to rewrite how interoperability, tooling, and real-world blockchain applications function. Built from the ground up to empower builders, businesses, and buyers alike, Qubetics is rolling through its 30th presale stage with momentum that’s turning heads for all the right reasons.
Behind every real breakout project is a tool that simplifies the chaos. Qubetics introduces QubeQode IDE, a streamlined development environment designed to make smart contract creation feel less like rocket science and more like drag-and-drop. Whether you’re a solo developer in Austin building a cross-chain loyalty app or a team of fintech professionals in Toronto launching tokenized assets, QubeQode makes it faster, cleaner, and easier.
This IDE is seamlessly integrated into the Qubetics multi-chain ecosystem, offering functionality across networks without the usual headaches—no wrapped tokens, no endless bridge confirmations, no centralized middlemen. Users, from crypto-curious accountants to full-stack devs, get the freedom to work across protocols with confidence. And the beauty of it? It doesn’t require them to compromise on decentralization or security. That’s exactly the kind of infrastructure needed to scale blockchain into real-world adoption.

Qubetics isn’t trying to be the loudest project in the room—it’s just checking all the boxes the rest forgot existed. Regulatory compatibility, audit-ready token tools, privacy features, and user-first design. No gimmicks, just tools that work.
Right now, Qubetics is in Stage 30 of its ongoing presale. Over 508 million $TICS tokens have been sold to a growing community of 24,800+ backers, generating more than $16.1 million in committed capital. The current token price is locked in at $0.1729. And that entry point still offers some serious upside—especially when you look at how early buyers from Stage 1 are sitting on 1629% returns already.
It’s far from over. At this current stage price, buyers can still secure a 477% ROI if $TICS reaches $1 post-presale. Should it climb to $5, that’s 2789% ROI. A $6 target puts it at 3367%, while a breakout to $10 pushes returns to 5678%. And if the mainnet momentum drives $TICS to $15, the result is an 8567% ROI from the current entry.
For any serious backer searching for the best crypto presale, Qubetics checks every box. It’s live, it’s accessible, and it’s moving capitalized utility into the spotlight. This isn’t about speculation—it’s about catching the next framework every new blockchain builder might soon rely on.
Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Qubetics isn’t guessing. It’s shipping.
Bitcoin may not be in price discovery mode right now, but that doesn’t mean it’s asleep. The latest technical indicators paint a mixed, but quietly bullish, picture. The MACD just crossed above the signal line on April 11th, and the RSI is inching closer to trend-shift territory. The price currently sits 2.17% above the 20-day average, though it still trails the 200-day moving average by about 9.55%.
AI models forecast Bitcoin to potentially reach $143,440.09 this year, with an average projected trading level around $123,183.51. If BTC holds support above the 20-day SMA and breaks toward the 50-day marker, a rally toward the $100K+ zone isn’t out of the question. For buyers looking beyond this cycle, longer-term models show a future trajectory cresting over $1.2 million by 2030.
Bitcoin remains the benchmark. But in today’s market, it also faces pressure from projects offering utility-based growth. That’s why it’s still essential to track how it plays into broader portfolio strategies—especially when assets like Qubetics are grabbing ROI-heavy attention.

TAO isn’t behaving like a sleepy altcoin—it’s responding quickly to macroeconomic triggers and technical setups. After a steep Sunday drop to $183, the price jumped over 18% on Monday, bouncing back above $230. The rally didn’t stop there. TAO pushed past its 20-day SMA on Friday, closing at $250, and settled at $254 the next day. It’s since seen a modest correction and is now trading around $242.
What stands out here isn’t just the price—it’s the resilience. Every dip has brought in new buyers, and the 20-day SMA is acting as a dynamic support zone. The recent tariff pause announcement added fuel, triggering a sudden influx of capital.
TAO isn’t one to ignore, especially for analysts watching high-volatility coins with strong AI and Web3 utility angles. Still, it lacks the structured utility suite that Qubetics is already deploying. That puts Qubetics ahead for buyers focusing on sustainable growth, not just short-term swings.
Why did this coin make it to this list? Because TAO brings technical intrigue and short-term gains, perfect for active traders watching resistance zones and SMA pivots.
Bitcoin brings market leadership and long-term value. TAO adds volatility and reaction-driven opportunity. But Qubetics offers something else entirely—a live product suite, a development-focused IDE, a multi-chain wallet, and tokenized interoperability, all wrapped inside the most accessible, best-performing top crypto presale active today.
This isn’t about guessing which project might pump next week. It’s about identifying where real utility meets early-stage opportunity. Qubetics is making that case with every milestone. For backers who understand timing, traction, and technical strength, this is one of the most strategically sound plays in 2025.
Now’s the time to evaluate before the window closes. With ROI still in play and adoption tools already live, Qubetics is more than hype—it’s the infrastructure for what’s next.

Welcome to the US Morning Crypto News Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead.
Grab a coffee to see what analysts say about Gold hitting new all-time highs while Bitcoin lags behind. At this point, many in the crypto community are wondering if the ‘Digital Gold’ narrative is beginning to unravel.
Gold prices have reached an all-time high of $3,317 per ounce, a 25% climb since the start of the year. Analysts say this surge highlights growing investor anxiety over the turbulent global economic climate, fueled largely by a tit-for-tat trade war among major economies. 
These developments have also stirred debate about the potential impact on Bitcoin, with experts offering insights on whether the digital currency will see a similar uptick in value or remain largely unaffected. 
“Bitcoin has closed the first quarter of 2025 with a 11.8% decline and recent fluctuations in the last two months highlight Bitcoin is extremely sensitive to macro-economic factors,” Paybis Chief Executive Officer Innokenty Isers told BeInCrypto. 
Isers believes that in the short term, Bitcoin remains highly correlated with the traditional market.
“Bitcoin’s correlation with equities—most notably a 0.72 correlation with the S&P 500— has led some investors to re-evaluate its position as ‘digital gold’ narrative—at least in the short term,” he added.
Moreover, Isers added that the correlation between Bitcoin and gold remains low at 0.2. This indicates that the returns of the two assets have largely moved independently. 
“Historically, this correlation has rarely exceeded 0.3, which highlights a limited linear co-movement between the two. In the recent months, Bitcoin has exhibited characteristics more akin to a tech stock than a traditional digital gold,” Isers stated.
The Paybis executive said that from a broader macro perspective, Bitcoin’s Fear and Greed Index reads 29, which suggests market sentiment is still stuck in the fear zone—even with a slight recovery. 
“At the same time, Bitcoin ETFs have seen steady outflows throughout April, despite the asset’s price climbing. So far, outflows have totaled $812.3 million this month, with BlackRock’s IBIT accounting for the largest share,” Isers said.
According to Wednesday’s QCP capital observation, despite a modest rebound in recent days, Bitcoin has yet to exhibit signs of safe-haven demand.
Looking at the macro picture, investor eyes will be on the US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at the Economic Club of Chicago later today. Market proponents are cautiously expecting the next clues on rate cuts and some clarity on tariff-driven inflation. 
Earlier this week, Fed Governor Christopher Waller also suggested that the central bank may be underestimating the persistence of inflationary pressures. At the moment, market proponents are cautiously hoping for some sign of direction.

Semler Scientific (SMLR), a US-based medical technology company, has revealed plans to acquire more Bitcoin (BTC) despite facing a 5.0% unrealized loss on its previous BTC investments. 
The firm has filed a Form S-3 registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to raise up to $500 million through a securities offering. The proceeds would be allocated for general corporate purposes, including expanding its Bitcoin portfolio.
According to the official filing, the firm plans to issue common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, and warrants as part of the securities offering. The SEC filing does not specify the exact amount allocated for Bitcoin purchases. Nonetheless, Semler’s recent activity suggests a strong focus on cryptocurrency.
“We have not determined the amount of net proceeds to be used specifically for such purposes. As a result, management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds of any offering,” the filing read.
This move follows Semler’s previous acquisition of 871 BTC for $88.5 million at an average price of $101,616 per Bitcoin. The purchases were made between January 11 and February 3. 
The acquisition increased Semler’s total Bitcoin holdings to 3,192 BTC. The holdings worth $266.1 million represent 80.6% of the company’s total market capitalization of 330.1 million. This indicates that a significant portion of its value is tied to its Bitcoin investments.
“From January 1, 2025, to February 3, 2025, Semler Scientific’s BTC Yield was 21.9%. From July 1, 2024 (the first full quarter after Semler Scientific adopted its bitcoin treasury strategy) to February 3, 2025, Semler Scientific’s BTC Yield was 152.2%,” the firm revealed.
However, the tides have shifted since then. According to Bitcoin Treasuries, Semler’s average BTC acquisition cost is $87,850 per coin. As of the latest data from BeInCrypto, Bitcoin’s market price stood at $83,397, placing Semler at a 5.0% loss on its investment. 
Previously, BeInCrypto noted that the losses surged to 14.7% as BTC fell below the $80,000 mark. Despite this, Semler’s leadership appears committed to its Bitcoin strategy, viewing the cryptocurrency as a long-term store of value.
Semler’s strategic push into Bitcoin mirrors those of other firms, such as Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and Metaplanet. Earlier this week, the firms acquired BTC worth $285 million and $26.3 million, respectively. 
However, Semler’s decision to double down on Bitcoin comes amid financial and legal challenges. On April 15, the company announced a preliminary $29.75 million settlement with the US Department of Justice (DOJ) to resolve allegations of violating federal anti-fraud laws related to marketing its QuantaFlo product.
The settlement is pending final approval. Yet, it adds pressure to Semler’s balance sheet as it navigates its ambitious fundraising and Bitcoin investment plans.

The world's largest crypto Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading 2.94% down at $83,313.48, sliding below the psychological mark of $85,000.
Other major crypto coins, Ethereum, XRP and Binance Coin are also trading lower by up to 5%. Blockchain Solana is currently down 6.01%, while DOGE is also trading 4.68% lower. Other cryptocurrencies like Cardano and LEO are also trading at -6.37% and -0.39%, respectively.
In line with a fall in the equities market, the global crypto market cap stands at $2.64 trillion today, 2.52% lower than the last day.


Despite the recent decline in major cryptocurrencies, market sentiment remains cautiously ""optimistic"". Bitcoin's drop below $84,000 and Ethereum's falling staking balance show ""investor nervousness"", but the recent whale accumulation and technical indicators indicate strength, Avinash Shekhar, Co-Founder & CEO, Pi42.
One driving factor behind the caution is the U.S. Federal Reserve's latest statement, especially by Fed member Raphael Bostic, which warned of a ""thick fog"" looming on the U.S. economy's horizon. These works indicate ongoing inflationary worries and potential delayed interest rate reductions, which could impact financial markets, including crypto, Shekhar adds.
""While institutional demand and strategic buying persist, the crypto space appears to be positioning itself for a possible rebound, stating that in the face of uncertainty, conviction and long-term belief in the crypto market continues to guide investor behaviour,"" says Shekhar tells Fortune India.
Alankar Saxena, Co-founder and CTO of Mudrex, agrees that investors' confidence remains ""strong"" on the hopes of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve in the U.S. ""This could make the U.S. a potential buyer of Bitcoin, significantly boosting demand for the asset,"" he says.
Another factor behind the optimism is that the number of Bitcoin Whales, individuals or entities who own at least 1,000 BTC to 10,000 BTC, has surged to 2,014, up 3.5% in a month. ""BTC faces resistance at $87,200, while the immediate support stands at $83,000,"" Saxena adds.
However, many view it as a logical correction in the crypto market. The CoinSwitch Markets data shows BTC is sitting under both its 50- and 100-day moving averages. It attributes the current dip in the market to a broader market pullback, with U.S. equities also edging lower — the Dow Jones fell 0.4%, the S&P 500 dropped 0.2%, and the Nasdaq slipped 0.1% on Tuesday.

Bitcoin seems to be stabilizing after a period of uncertainty. A key indicator from the largest crypto exchange Binance also shows buyers returning. This development could signal a significant trend reversal in the coming weeks. More details in the paragraphs below!
According to the latest data from Binance, the buyer/seller ratio of BTC has reached neutrality. More explicitly, this indicates that buyers are beginning to dominate transaction volumes.
Currently, this ratio stands at 1.008. A positive sign for those betting on a rise in bitcoin price. When this ratio exceeds 1, it indeed suggests that buyers are controlling the market. Enough to create upward pressure!
This momentum is reinforced by the soaring transaction volumes on Binance. This reveals growing confidence in the flagship crypto asset.
At the time of writing this article, bitcoin is trading around $83,810. Several crypto experts predict a return to $85,000 if this trend continues. Such a rise could:
Bitcoin dominance is steadily increasing, reaching 63.81% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. This represents an increase of nearly 10% since the start of 2025. This is a clear sign that investors favor bitcoin over altcoins.
This concentration of volumes on BTC is a decisive factor in the resurgence of bullish sentiment. Data indeed shows that bitcoin dominance is still increasing, thereby reinforcing its role as a safe haven asset in an extremely volatile crypto market.
Bitcoin bulls therefore seem to be making a strong comeback. If this momentum is confirmed, BTC could well resume its upward trajectory to new highs. However, investors must remain cautious in the face of overall uncertainty in the crypto market.

Healthcare technology company Semler Scientific Inc. SMLR announced its latest securities offering Tuesday to add to its fast-expanding Bitcoin BTC/USD stockpile.
What happened: In a Form S-3 registration statement with the SEC, the firm proposed to offer $500 million in securities, including debt securities, common stock, units, and warrants.
""We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of any securities offered under this prospectus primarily for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin,"" Semler said. 
Semler adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset in May 2024,  funding its purchases through corporate maneuvers such as equity and debt financings, as well as cash flows from its operations.

Earlier in January, the firm issued convertible bonds worth $85 million and used proceeds from the transaction to add to its Bitcoin reserves.
Metaplanet owned 3,192 BTCs worth $280 million as of this writing, making it the 12th-largest corporate holder of the leading cryptocurrency, according to BitcoinTreasuries data. 
Interestingly, the decision to buy more comes despite the firm’s 5% unrealized loss on Bitcoin assets.
Why It Matters: Semler's fundraising efforts come amid a broader trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption, evangelized by Michael Saylor's Strategy Inc. MSTR, the world's biggest BTC hoarder.
Japan-based Metaplanet Inc. MTPLF, currently the tenth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder, has followed the same playbook.
In other news, Semler reached a $29.75 million settlement with the Justice Department, resolving claims of violations of a federal anti-fraud law related to its marketing of a product known as QuantaFlo.
Price Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin traded at $83,169.20, down 3.11% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. 
Semler shares were down 0.15% in after-hours trading after closing 0.41% higher at $34.40 during Tuesday’s regular session. 
The stock demonstrated high momentum—the measure of a stock’s relative strength based on its price movement patterns and volatility over multiple timeframes—as of this writing. Visit Benzinga Edge Stock Rankings to compare how other Bitcoin-buying companies like Strategy score on this metric.

Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck, has proposed a new financial instrument, “BitBonds,” to help manage the US government’s looming $14 trillion refinancing debt requirement.
The 10-year financial instrument combines traditional US Treasury bonds with Bitcoin (BTC) exposure. This offers a potential solution to the nation’s fiscal concerns.
According to Sigel’s proposal, BitBonds’ investment structure allocates 90% of the funds to low-risk US Treasury securities and 10% to Bitcoin, combining stability with the potential for higher returns. Additionally, the government would purchase Bitcoin with proceeds from the bond sale.
Investors would receive all Bitcoin gains up to a maximum annualized yield-to-maturity of 4.5%. Furthermore, the investor and the government would split any additional gains equally. 
“An aligned solution for mismatched incentives,” Sigel remarked.
From an investor perspective, Sigel highlighted that the bond offers a breakeven Bitcoin compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 8% and 17%, depending on the coupon rate. Additionally, investors’ returns could skyrocket if Bitcoin grows at a 30%–50% CAGR. 
“A convex bet—if you believe in Bitcoin,” he added.
However, the structure is not without risks: investors bear Bitcoin’s downside while only partially participating in its upside. Lower-coupon bonds may lose appeal if Bitcoin underperforms. 
Meanwhile, the Treasury’s downside is limited. Even a complete collapse of Bitcoin’s value would still result in cost savings compared to traditional bond issuance. Yet, this is contingent on the coupon remaining below the breakeven threshold.
“BTC upside just sweetens the deal. Worst case: cheap funding. Best case: long-vol exposure to the hardest asset on Earth,” Sigel stated.
Sigel claimed that this hybrid approach aligns the interests of the government and investors over a 10-year period. The government faces high interest rates and significant debt refinancing needs. Meanwhile, investors seek protection from inflation and asset debasement.
The proposal comes amid growing concerns over the US debt crisis, exacerbated by the recent increase in the debt ceiling to $36.2 trillion, as reported by BeInCrypto. Notably, the Bitcoin Policy Institute (BPI) has also endorsed the concept. 
“Building on President Donald J. Trump’s March 6, 2025, Executive Order establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, this white paper proposes that the United States adopt Bitcoin-Enhanced US Treasury Bonds (“₿ Bonds” or “BitBonds”) as an innovative fiscal tool to address multiple critical objectives,” the brief read. 
In the paper, co-authors Andrew Hohns and Matthew Pines suggested that issuing $2 trillion in BitBonds at a 1% interest rate could cover 20% of the Treasury’s 2025 refinancing needs. 
“Over a ten-year period, this represents nominal savings of $700 billion and a present value of $554.4 billion,” the authors wrote.
BPI estimates that if Bitcoin achieves a CAGR of 36.6%, the upside could potentially defease up to $50.8 trillion of federal debt by 2045.
These recommendations are part of broader conversations regarding Bitcoin’s potential impact on national finance. Previously, Senator Cynthia Lummis argued that a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve could halve the national debt. In fact, VanEck’s analysis indicated that such a reserve could help reduce $21 trillion of debt by 2049.

Cryptocurrency prices are down across the board over the last 24 hours amid a wider risk asset sell-off triggered by deepening U.S.-China trade tensions.
The White House said China now “faces up to a 245% tariff on imports” and imposed new restrictions on chip exports to the country. Bitcoin (BTC) fell more than 2.2% while the broader market, measured by the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index, declined 3.75%.
Nasdaq 100 futures are also down, losing more than 1% while S&P 500 futures dropped 0.65%. While bitcoin has remained notably stable as the trade war escalated, some metrics suggest the bull run may have ended.
The largest cryptocurrency slipped below its 200-day simple moving average on March 9, suggesting “the token’s recent steep decline qualifies this as a bear market cycle starting in late March,” Coinbase Institutional said in a note 
A risk-adjusted performance measured in standard deviations known as the Z-Score shows the bull cycle ended in late February, with subsequent activity seen as neutral, according to Coinbase Institutional's global head of research, David Duong.
Still, the resilience cryptocurrency prices have shown is “undoubtedly good for the market,” as it lets traders “look more seriously at using premium to hedge — supporting the case for allocating into spot,” said Jake O., an OTC trader at crypto market maker Wintermute.
“In response, several prime brokers have shifted their short-term models from underweight to neutral on risk assets, noting that the next move will likely be driven by ‘real’ data,” Jake O. Said in an emailed statement.
That “real data” is coming in soon enough, with the U.S. Census Bureau set to release March retail sales data, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivering a speech on economic outlook. Tomorrow, the U.S. Department of Labor releases unemployment insurance data and the Census Bureau releases residential construction data, while the ECB is expected to cut interest rates.
The shakiness in risk assets has benefited gold. The precious metal is up around 26.5% year-to-date to above $3,300 per troy ounce, contrasting with the U.S. Dollar Index’s 9% drop. Stay alert!

Is this cause for concern among investors? Amid profit-taking, technical indicators, and tense macroeconomic conditions, let's examine this unexpected pullback.
Written by Hugo Le follézou

The plunge of Bitcoin below the $84,000 mark has created an air of uncertainty in the crypto and stock markets. After reaching historic highs in November 2021, the world’s largest cryptocurrency underwent a significant correction. It lost almost 30% of its value in just a few weeks.

This sudden drop caught many investors off guard, leaving them pondering whether this marks the beginning of a sustainable trend reversal or just a temporary fluctuation. Crypto analyst Émilie Girard explains, “The market had become extremely volatile recently, with significant price movements in both directions. This drop below $84,000 reflects some nervousness among investors regarding the uncertain trajectory of Bitcoin.”
Several factors have contributed to this Bitcoin decline. Firstly, the current macroeconomic environment, with the prospect of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, has dampened investors’ risk appetite. Financial expert Étienne Dupont analyzes, “High inflation and monetary tightening measures have created an atmosphere of uncertainty that is affecting risk assets like Bitcoin.”
Additionally, regulators have also been under increased scrutiny in recent months, especially regarding the regulation of cryptocurrencies. “Announcements and decisions by authorities on crypto regulation can have a significant impact on market sentiment,” notes Émilie Girard.
Lastly, liquidating substantial positions in derivative markets may have amplified volatility and exacerbated Bitcoin’s decline. “When large players liquidate their positions, it can trigger market panic,” explains Étienne Dupont.
Despite this correction, experts remain fairly optimistic about the future of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as a whole. Émilie Girard reassures, “Bitcoin has gone through many phases of volatility in the past, always bouncing back and reaching new highs. The fundamentals of blockchain and the crypto-economy remain strong, with many exciting developments and innovations ahead.”
Étienne Dupont agrees, “Even though the market is currently turbulent, I believe that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies still have bright days ahead. It remains a particularly interesting asset for the long term, especially for portfolio diversification.”
Therefore, savvy investors would be wise to remain vigilant and closely monitor the market’s evolution in the coming weeks and months. Beyond the current turmoil, crypto still holds a strong long-term growth potential. So, is it the right time to invest?

Semler Scientific is ramping up its bitcoin strategy with a $500 million securities offering and a new loan agreement with Coinbase.
Public medial device maker Semler Scientific has filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to offer up to $500 million in securities, with the intent to use some of the proceeds to buy more Bitcoin (BTC).
In the S-3 statement, the Nasdaq-listed healthcare tech firm said it may sell common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units over time. The proceeds will be used “primarily for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin,” according to the filing.
In the filing, the company also doubled down on its crypto strategy, saying it views Bitcoin holdings “as long term holdings and expect to continue to accumulate Bitcoin.” Semler Scientific noted though that it hasn’t set “any specific target for the amount of Bitcoin we seek to hold, and we will continue to monitor market conditions in determining whether to engage in additional Bitcoin purchases.”
Semler started buying Bitcoin in May 2024 and now holds 3,192 BTC worth about $315 million, according to data from Bitcoin Treasuries. Semler also disclosed a master loan agreement with Coinbase that would allow it to borrow using Bitcoin as collateral. In a separate filing, Semler said it reached an agreement-in-principle with the Department of Justice to pay $29.75 million to settle claims tied to the False Claims Act.

        Share    
Oklahoma’s proposed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (HB1203) has failed to advance in the Senate Revenue and Taxation Committee, following a narrow 6–5 vote against the bill.
The bill aimed to authorize the State Treasurer to invest funds from the State General Fund, Revenue Stabilization Fund, and Constitutional Reserve Fund in Bitcoin (BTC) and other major digital assets (with market caps over $500 billion), including stablecoins. Investments would have been capped at 10% of funds per account, and assets would be held with regulated custodians.
The bill also included provisions for using digital asset staking and integrating crypto investment options into state retirement funds. It specified that taxes or fees paid in BTC in must be converted into dollars before being transferred to the state treasury.
The bill was initially introduced to the Oklahoma House of Representatives on Jan. 15 by representative Cody Maynard, who voiced strong support for BTC as a hedge against government overreach and inflation., stating: 
“Bitcoin represents freedom from bureaucrats printing away our purchasing power. As a decentralized form of money, Bitcoin cannot be manipulated or created by government entities. It is the ultimate store of value for those who believe in financial freedom and sound money principles.”
The bill then passed the Government Oversight Committee with a 12–2 vote on Feb. 25 and then the full House with a 77–15 vote on March 24.
However, HB1203 faced bipartisan opposition in the latest committee vote on April 14. The six “No” votes came from Senators Todd Gollihare (R), Chuck Hall (R), Brent Howard (R), Julia Kirt (D), Mark Mann (D), and Dave Rader (R).
With this vote, Oklahoma exits the Bitcoin Reserve Race, leaving Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas as leading contenders in the state-level adoption of crypto investment strategies. The bill, originally slated to take effect on Nov. 1 this year, will not move forward.

Renowned economist Peter Schiff questioned the integrity of Bitcoin BTC/USD proponents on Tuesday, claiming that they no longer shared his economic concerns following the election of President Donald Trump.
What Happened: Without taking any names, Schiff took to X to question the rationale behind Bitcoin advocates’ continued endorsement of the apex cryptocurrency despite their newfound optimism about the U.S. economy.
“Before Trump was elected, most of the big names in Bitcoin shared my concerns about the U.S. economy, deficits, and inflation,” the staunch Bitcoin critic said. “However, since Trump was elected, while my outlook has remained consistent, they have done a complete 180.”
Before Trump was elected, most of the big names in Bitcoin shared my concerns about the U.S. economy, deficits, and inflation. But while I recommend gold as a hedge, they recommended Bitcoin. However, since Trump was elected, while my outlook has remained consistent, they have…
Don't Miss:
Schiff outlined three possible explanations for this paradox. First, he theorized that Bitcoin advocates may still harbor the same concerns but feel compelled to support the economy due to Trump’s pro-Bitcoin stance. 
Second, rather than concerns about debt or inflation, which Bitcoin advocates have traditionally cited as reasons for supporting the asset, their bullish outlook may now be based on growing demand from the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, foreign governments, and institutional investors. 
Lastly, Schiff suggested that these advocates may have never truly believed in the economic concerns they voiced and merely used them as talking points to promote Bitcoin.
A popular trading-related X account, Stockwits Academy, responded sharply to Schiff’s remarks, questioning the notion that consistency is a virtue in a world dominated by centralized organizations.
“Bitcoiners aren't pivoting because they trust Trump, they're doubling down because they don't trust the system,” Stockwits Academy said. “Trump or Biden, Powell or Yellen, the clown show doesn't stop. Bitcoin is a vote of no confidence in all of them.”
Peter, you're making the mistake of assuming consistency is a virtue in a world run by central banks and career politicians. Let's be real, the U.S. economy didn't magically get fixed because a different puppet took the stage. The rot is systemic, and anyone pretending otherwise…
Why It Matters:  Schiff’s skepticism toward Bitcoin is not new. He previously referred to Bitcoin as a “digital risk” during times of economic uncertainty and predicted that the ongoing financial turmoil of 2025 could mark its end. 
He has also criticized the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, stating that it exists solely to “scam” more Americans into buying loss-making cryptocurrencies.
Price Action:  At the time of writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $83,417.33, down 2.73% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

In a period marked by economic turbulence, Strategy is quietly outperforming Silicon Valley’s brightest stars, delivering a staggering 133% return over the past 12 months.
The company’s Bitcoin-holding plan has seen it eclipse the so-called “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks, which have slumped under the weight of a global trade war.
Data from financial research platform YCharts shows that as of April 15, Strategy’s one-year total returns stood at about 133%, dunking on the once-unshakeable Wall Street giants.
Tesla, the best-performing among the seven, lags far behind Strategy, managing only 57% returns year-over-year. The second best was Nvidia, which, reeling from a $5.5 billion hit due to U.S.-China chip restrictions, is up 30%, followed by Apple at 17%.
Meanwhile, Meta and Google are hovering near stagnation, managing 12-month returns of 4% and 2%, respectively. Amazon and Microsoft are posting outright losses, their growth narratives knocked sideways by macroeconomic headwinds.
Strategy’s performance is even more remarkable when examined within the context of the disruptions caused to global markets after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on nearly every major trading partner.
The move resulted in the S&P 500 shedding over 6% to record its worst week since the COVID crash, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the Dow Jones dropping into bear market territory, losing more than $5 trillion in market cap in just days.
Amid the turmoil, Strategy has kept up its Bitcoin accumulation. Just days ago, it bought 3,459 BTC for around $286 million at an average price of $82,618.
That purchase followed an even larger buy of 22,048 BTC for $1.92 billion in late March. It now holds 531,644 BTC, acquired at an average price of $67,556, and is worth nearly $36 billion.
The company’s performance against the tech titans had Executive Chairman Michael Saylor gloating on X:
“There is a @Strategy to beat the Magnificent 7.”
His boast triggered a wave of commentary, with supporters hailing it as a masterclass in conviction:
“Turns out holding satoshis on corporate balance sheets hits harder than holding PR budgets,” quipped one X user.
At the same time, another added, “Outperforming the Magnificent 7 with 21 million reasons,” alluding to BTC’s total supply.
But not everyone is convinced. “What happens when we dip and you get a margin call like in 2022?” asked a community member, echoing lingering concerns about overexposure.
Indeed, that fear almost materialized earlier in the month. MSTR stock went from $340 in late March to under $240 on April 8 following rumors that Strategy could be forced to sell its Bitcoin amidst a broader market rout. However, by the following Monday, the stock had recovered to $300, posting a 15% weekly gain and silencing speculation.

Gold has surpassed its all-time high, energizing investors.
Gold advocate Peter Schiff urges investors to sell Bitcoin amid its recent drop.
Gold mining stocks are surging, contrasting with Bitcoin's recent decline and the tech sector's YTD loss.
According To Google Finance today, gold has just shattered its all-time high, soaring past the $3,300 mark – and it’s got the entire market talking. The sharp upward movement has energized investors, especially gold enthusiasts. 
But while gold is grabbing headlines, Bitcoin is quietly slipping. Peter Schiff, a well-known advocate for gold, has used this moment to question Bitcoin’s future, even urging investors to sell all their Bitcoin holdings.
In my opinion, the best trade you can make right now is to sell all your Bitcoin and any other crypto you may hold and go all-in on gold and silver mining stocks. Don't wait. Sell right now and move into miners ASAP. You can thank me later.https://t.co/IUE4Y24K6b
Are we heading for trouble? Let’s break it down.
Gold recently surged past $3,300, a major milestone in its ongoing rally. At the beginning of April, gold was priced at $3,114.04, but there was some fluctuation early in the month. Between April 3 and 7, the price dropped from $3,131.08 to $2,980.78. This dip coincided with global market uncertainty caused by U.S. President Donald Trump’s aggressive tariff policy and a 90-day pause for non-retaliating countries.
On April 8, gold’s market experienced a key moment as buyers and sellers fought it out, forming a long-legged Doji candlestick pattern on the daily chart. This pattern indicated indecision, but soon after, the market made a clear move.
Starting April 9, the trend shifted, and gold began to climb steadily. Between April 9 and 11, gold’s price jumped by over 8.52%, signaling a strong bullish momentum. As of today, gold sits at $3,296.74, and the market looks set for further growth.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin is struggling. The cryptocurrency has dropped below $83,380, losing over 2.6% in just the past 24 hours. Compared to its peak earlier in the month, Bitcoin is down by 5.87% and 23.53% below its all-time high of $109,000.
A Tough Start to 2025
The first quarter of 2025 has been tough for Bitcoin, with a drop of at least 11.7%. This is a stark contrast to the same period last year when Bitcoin saw a 68.7% rise.
Peter Schiff, a prominent critic of Bitcoin, has advised investors to sell their Bitcoin holdings and turn to gold instead.
As Schiff suggests, gold mining stocks have seen impressive growth. According to Yahoo Finance, companies involved in gold exploration, mining, and processing have experienced an average increase of 16.69% over the last 30 days.
The sector’s year-to-date (YTD) return stands at an impressive +47.16%, and its one-year return is +60.29%. Over the last three and five years, returns have been equally strong, at +26.77% and +73.77%, respectively.
Key gold sector companies are showing remarkable performance. For example, Newmont Corporation has a YTD increase of +46.64%, while AngloGold Ashanti has surged by +89.90%. Other notable companies include Royal Gold Inc (+40.31%), Seabridge Gold Inc (+9.20%), and Idaho Strategic Resources Inc (+78.41%).
Back in December 2024, Michael J. Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, urged major U.S. tech companies like Microsoft to adopt an aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Strategy, with 528,185 BTC tokens worth over $44 billion, holds the largest Bitcoin position among public companies.
Despite this, Peter Schiff has strongly criticized Strategy’s Bitcoin-focused strategy and even predicted Bitcoin could drop as low as $10,000. However, Strategy’s stock has outperformed U.S. tech stocks.
According to Yahoo Finance, Strategy’s stock has surged by 147.78% in the past year, with a YTD growth of 7.29%. In contrast, the broader U.S. tech sector has gained only 6.82% over the past year and has a YTD decline of -14.56%.
As gold continues to break new records and Bitcoin faces challenges, the battle between these two assets is heating up. Investors are closely watching the market, with many turning to gold as a safer option given Bitcoin’s volatility.
Whether this trend will continue remains to be seen, but for now, gold is enjoying its golden moment.
