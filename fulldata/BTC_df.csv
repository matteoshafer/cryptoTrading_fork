Bitcoin has surged over the last year, helped by U.S. president Donald Trump’s prediction that “massive” bitcoin and crypto investment is coming.

The bitcoin price, up around 50% since plummeting to April lows, has found a floor at $100,000 despite a surprise “big risk” recently emerging.
Now, after the U.S. Senate passed a crypto bill predicted to “unleash trillions,” the bitcoin price is braced for a Federal Reserve earthquake after Trump renewed his attack on chair Jerome Powell over interest rates as U.S. debt tops $37 trillion.

Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is under fire from U.S. president Donald Trump—with the bitcoin ... More price predicted to benefit if the Fed flips dovish.
""I don’t know why the board doesn’t override (Powell),"" Trump posted to his Truth Social account in a lengthy message in which he branded Powell a “moron"" and heavily criticized Fed policy that he claims is costing the U.S. $1 trillion per year in interest payments. ""Maybe, just maybe, I’ll have to change my mind about firing him? But regardless, his term ends shortly.""
U.S. debt has skyrocketed in recent years following huge government spending through the Covid-era and lockdowns, with interest rates that were rapidly hiked to rein in inflation adding to the cost of servicing the ballooning $37 trillion U.S. debt pile.
Earlier this month, Trump confirmed a decision on the next Federal Reserve chair will be coming out “ very soon,” after earlier warning he was considering firing Powell if rates weren’t brought down.
Trump also called Powell a “numbskull,"" adding: “I fully understand that my strong criticism of him makes it more difficult for him to do what he should be doing, lowering rates, but I’ve tried it all different ways. I’ve been nice, I’ve been neutral, and I’ve been nasty, and nice and neutral didn’t work!”
This week, the Fed kept interest rates on hold again after kicking of a reduction cycle in September that’s been put on pause due to fears Trump’s global trade tariffs could see a return of inflation.
However, Fed governor Christopher Waller has said he doesn’t expect Trump’s tariffs to drive inflation higher so policymakers should be looking to lower interest rates as early as July.
“If you’re starting to worry about the downside risk [to the] labor market, move now, don’t wait,” Waller told CNBC. The futures market currently puts the chances of a Fed rate cut in July at just 10%, according to CME FedWatch.
Lower interest rates are generally believed to be supportive of risk assets like bitcoin, crypto and high-growth technology stocks as money more easily flows though the economic system, with bitcoin price and crypto analysts predicting a bitcoin price boom if the Fed moves to rapidly reduce rates.

The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year, with U.S. president Donald Trump boosting ... More the bitcoin price and wider crypto market.
The “dot plot from the Federal Reserve was somewhat of a relief, with projections of two rate cuts this year alleviating fears of no more cuts at all in 2025,” Elliot Johnson, chief executive of the Bitcoin Treasury Corporation, said in emailed comments.
“But beyond this short-term noise, there are even more reasons to be optimistic. Bitcoin’s recent strength isn’t only a testament to its resilience or its growing appeal as a safe-haven asset, but also its growing importance as an alternative to the devaluing U.S. dollar and a legitimate long-term treasury asset.”
Others have pointed to bitcoin’s price performance through recent market volatility as helping to establish it as a safe-haven similar to gold.
“As confidence in a perfectly engineered ""soft landing"" wanes, and as global financial currents diverge, bitcoin’s fundamental properties—its scarcity, decentralization, and neutrality—make it an increasingly relevant and compelling asset for investors navigating an uncertain future,"" David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at 21Shares, said via email.
“Bitcoin has firmly cemented itself above $100,000, and its resilience amid geopolitical shocks demonstrates its widespread adoption and developing investment case.”

Now, crypto analyst Colin has indicated that the flagship crypto could still drop to as low as $92,800 and revealed what will happen if BTC gets there. 
The Current Bitcoin Price Action And What To Expect
In an X post, Colin said that it looks increasingly likely that the Bitcoin price will see a retest of at least 100,800 as the first major level of support. The analyst made this statement as BTC dropped out of a bullish pennant for a second time. The measured target for this bull pennant is $150,000. 
However, with the most recent breakdown, the Bitcoin price threatens to decline further before any potential move to the upside. Colin stated that the next major levels below $100,800 are $97,600 and $92,800. He opined that BTC is likely to quickly rebound from these support levels if it gets there. 
The crypto analyst remarked that this Bitcoin price movement is all possible within the confines of the right shoulder of the larger inverse Head-and-Shoulders pattern. He added that this can make the right shoulder more complete, basically on the same level as the left shoulder. This analysis comes just a day after Colin revealed that BTC has deviated from the global M2 money supply. 
However, he suggested that the BTC bull market is far from over. The analyst noted that the deviation happens 20% of the time and doesn’t invalidate the macro trend. Basically, the Bitcoin price is primed to rally higher at some point and possibly reach the $150,000 measured target. Market expert Raoul Pal also commented on BTC’s correlation with the money supply, stating that it shows that there is no need to worry about the current price action. 
Bulls Need To Step In For BTC
In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto stated that the Bulls need to step in now for the Bitcoin price. He noted that BTC is facing a key test, having just been rejected at the Fair Value Gap at around $106,000. The analyst added that the flagship crypto is now retesting the lower boundary of the symmetrical triangle. 
Titan of Crypto stated that if this lower boundary at around $104,000 fails, then the next level would be the previous weekly low at $102,679. If the Bitcoin price fails to hold that level, it could further drop to the liquidity pocket near $100,300. 
At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $103,500, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bulls have failed to keep the market green at the beginning of the weekend, according to CoinStats.
The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped by almost 2% since yesterday.
Despite today's decline, the rate of the main crypto is looking bullish on the hourly chart. If a breakout of the local resistance happens, the growth may continue to the $105,000 area.
From the midterm point of view, the picture is less clear.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction for June 20

ByDenys Serhiichuk




The volume remains low, which means traders are unlikely to witness sharp moves from BTC over the next few days.
From the midterm point of view, the price is on the way to the support of $100,764. If bulls lose that mark, the accumulated energy might be enough for a test of the $98,000-$100,000 range soon.
Bitcoin is trading at $103,940 at press time.

That's the message from an options-based strategy called 25-delta risk reversal, which involves the simultaneous purchase of a put option and sale of a call, or vice versa.
At the time of writing, risk reversals based on Deribit-listed bitcoin and ether options indicated that investors were positioning for downside volatility over the summer.
BTC's 25-delta risk reversals for June, July, and August tenors were negative, indicating a preference for put options, which offer downside protection, over calls or bullish bets, according to data source Amberdata. In ETH's case, puts were pricier out to the July end expiry.
Traders typically buy put options to hedge their long positions in the spot and futures markets, protecting themselves from potential price declines.
""Risk reversals in both BTC and ETH continue to show a preference for downside protection across June and September tenors. This suggests that long holders are actively hedging spot exposure and preparing for potential drawdowns,"" Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a market note.
The nervousness is evident from the over-the-counter liquidity platform Paradigm, where the top five BTC trades for the week include a put spread and a bearish risk reversal. Meanwhile, in ETH's case, a long position in the $2,450 put crossed the tape alongside a short strangle (volatility) trade.
Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has spent over 40 days trading back and forth above $100,000, according to CoinDesk data. According to analysts, profit-taking by long-term holders and miner selling have counteracted the strong uptake for spot ETFs, leaving prices directionless.
""Bitcoin has recently tracked sideways, suggesting its current price may be too high for many retail investors. Open interest in BTC options has risen, with a positive and rising 25 delta put-call skew on 30-day contracts, which may imply that market participants are seeking short-term protection through put options,"" Coinbase Institutional's weekly report noted.
On Friday, BTC closed (UTC) below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) to trade below the key support for the first time since mid-April. The breakdown may lead to more chart-driven selling, potentially resulting in a drop below $100,000.
Some observers, however, expect a rally to new record highs. According to market observer Cas Abbé, BTC's on-balance volume continues to indicate strong buying pressure, suggesting that prices could rise to $130,000-$135,000 by the end of the third quarter.

The firm reported that the ratio of bullish to bearish commentary has fallen to just 1.03 to 1 — the lowest since early April, when the President Donald Trump unveiled his so-called Liberation Day tariffs, triggering peak market fear at the time. 
Santiment emphasized that this current wave of retail pessimism is unusually intense and, based on past patterns, may mark a contrarian signal for a price rebound. They specifically noted that back in April, Bitcoin rallied shortly after similar fear levels surfaced, suggesting large investors often use periods of retail capitulation to accumulate at favorable prices.
Adding to the pressure is the Federal Reserve's recent decision to hold interest rates steady, which has kept btcoin trading in a relatively tight $100,000 to $110,000 range over the past month. Meanwhile, on-chain metrics show declining open interest on Binance, pointing to continued deleveraging among derivatives traders. At the same time, whale wallets have shown steady accumulation since 2023 — an indication that large holders are continuing to build their positions despite the short-term uncertainty.

As geopolitical tensions intensify and investor sentiment deteriorates, bearish pressure has continued spreading across Bitcoin’s spot and derivatives markets. 
The uncertainty surrounding global macroeconomic stability has led many market participants to take a risk-off approach, with the coin showing signs of vulnerability as the second quarter draws to a close.
With the coin struggling to rally momentum around the $103,000 price mark, Bitcoin futures traders have increasingly positioned against the coin. 
According to Coinglass, the coin’s long/short ratio — a key measure of trader sentiment — has tilted heavily toward shorts since June 17, indicating a growing belief that BTC’s recent rally may be losing momentum. At press time, the ratio is 0.95, indicating more traders are betting against the altcoin. 
This ratio compares the number of long and short positions in a market. When an asset’s long/short ratio is above 1, there are more long than short positions, indicating that traders are predominantly betting on a price increase.
Conversely, as seen with BTC, a ratio below one indicates that most traders are positioning for a price drop. This reflects heightened bearish sentiment and growing expectations of continued downside movements in the short term.
Moreover, daily chart readings from BTC’s BBTrend indicator reinforce the bearish outlook. As BTC’s price momentum weakens, the green histogram bars on the indicator have steadily fallen in size, signaling a decline in buying pressure and a loss of bullish strength.
The BBTrend is used to gauge the strength and direction of price trends. It appears as histogram bars — green when the trend is bullish and red when bearish. 
When the BBTrend turns negative or the green bars shrink, upward momentum is fading, and the asset may be entering a consolidation phase or facing a reversal. 
A consistently negative BBTrend suggests that selling pressure is dominating, increasing the likelihood of an extended price correction for BTC.
Yesterday, BTC’s price fell to a 15-day low of $102,345. Although it rebounded and closed at $103,297, bearish pressure remains, with the coin still down 2% over the past 24 hours.
If new demand continues to be limited, BTC’s price could extend its dip toward $101,520. Should the bulls fail to defend this critical support level, the asset could plunge further to $97,658.
On the other hand, if buying pressure strengthens, BTC could rebound and attempt a break above $103,952. A successful move past this level may open the door for a rally toward $106,295.

Industry commentators are debating which asset, XRP or Bitcoin, offers a better investment opportunity at current price levels.
Leading the conversation is Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy. He suggests that XRP presents a more attractive risk-reward profile in the current market cycle. According to him, XRP’s price potential remains conservative and realistic compared to Bitcoin trading above $100,000.
“You’d have to be insane to think Bitcoin at $106K is a better investment than XRP,” he said.
Notably, XRP is trading around $2. Farina’s statement implies that the coin could outperform and deliver greater returns than Bitcoin, which is already in the six-figure price range.
Farina points to previous market conditions, such as when XRP was $0.50 while Bitcoin traded at $70,000 in 2024. From that range, XRP went on to reach $3.40, offering approximately a 7X return for holders.
To put it in perspective: 100,000 XRP tokens purchased at $0.50 in November 2024 for $50,000 would have grown to $340,000 by January 2025. With XRP’s current price at $2.10, the asset still holds over 4X gains for those investors.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin rose from about $68,000 during the same period to a new all-time high of approximately $112,000. This amounted to a 64% gain, whereas XRP delivered nearly ten times more. For comparison, $50,000 invested in Bitcoin in November 2024 reached a peak value of only around $82,352.
In contrast, the same $50,000 invested in XRP grew to $340,000. Given this significant performance gap, XRP proponents continue to advocate for the asset over Bitcoin.
One commenter responding to Farina’s post emphasized that the conversation isn’t about being anti-Bitcoin, but about recognizing asymmetric opportunities. 
With XRP at $2, they argued that even a move to $5 or $10 would represent significant upside in multiples higher than what Bitcoin could realistically achieve from its current position.
Another user highlighted the limitations of average retail investors, noting that most people don’t have $10,000 to invest in Bitcoin, let alone expect it to multiply several times over. 
They argued that allocating such capital to XRP makes more sense from a return-on-investment perspective. At current prices, $10,000 would buy only about 0.09 BTC, which would return $47,000 if Bitcoin hit $500,000, a scenario they called a “big if.” 
By contrast, XRP offers significantly higher ROI potential for the same investment, in their view. Farina agrees with this perspective. 
In a previous commentary, he boldly asserted that if Bitcoin rose to $500,000, XRP could soar to $100. In that case, Bitcoin would deliver a 5X gain for holders, while XRP would yield over 40X.
However, critics are challenging the pro-XRP narrative against Bitcoin. One commenter questioned the comparison by highlighting XRP’s historical performance.
Specifically, they noted that while Bitcoin has risen from $20,000 to over $112,000 since its 2017–2018 highs, XRP has still not returned to its previous all-time high from the same period. 
This challenges the assumption that XRP’s lower price relative to Bitcoin means it will necessarily perform better in the future, particularly given XRP’s long-standing historical underperformance.

Sellers are stepping in at key supply zones, pushing back against attempts to enter price discovery above the $112K all-time high. Despite this pressure, Bitcoin remains resilient above the psychologically significant $100K mark, where it has found support since early June.
The latest on-chain data from Gemini and Glassnode reveals a noteworthy structural shift: over 30% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply is now held by just 216 centralized entities. These include exchanges, ETFs, funds, public and private companies, DeFi contracts, and even governments. Exchanges currently hold the largest share, while public companies represent the most numerous holders. This trend highlights the deepening custodial centralization of Bitcoin, raising both adoption optimism and decentralization concerns.
As the macroeconomic backdrop remains volatile—with high US Treasury yields, the Fed holding interest rates, and geopolitical tensions intensifying—Bitcoin’s price action is becoming increasingly sensitive to shifts in sentiment and liquidity. Whether BTC can hold this key support or slide deeper into correction will depend on upcoming volume reactions and potential moves from these dominant custodial players.
Bitcoin is currently down 8% from its $112K all-time high, hovering in a broad consolidation phase with no decisive breakout. The price action suggests that the market is at a critical juncture, with traders split between two possibilities: a deeper retracement toward the $94K level or a renewed push into price discovery. This indecision is amplified by ongoing geopolitical tensions, particularly the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Many analysts warn that if the United States steps in, it could trigger panic across global markets, creating spillover effects into the crypto space.
Meanwhile, key insights from Glassnode and Gemini shed light on a growing trend in Bitcoin’s ownership structure. Over 30% of the circulating supply is now held by just 216 centralized entities. This reflects a dual narrative—on one hand, increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve or investment asset, and on the other, rising custodial centralization that may undermine the network’s decentralized ethos.
The largest holdings belong to crypto exchanges, ETFs, and funds, followed by public and private companies that have allocated BTC to their balance sheets. A notable portion is also locked in DeFi contracts, with some controlled by governments following seizures or strategic acquisitions.
While this growing centralization may boost credibility and capital inflow, it also introduces new risks to liquidity and distribution. In such a fragile macro environment, Bitcoin’s next major move will depend not only on technical setups but also on the behavior of these key holders under pressure.
Bitcoin has retraced from its recent local high of $106,500 and is now trading around the $103,100 mark, testing a key support level highlighted in yellow on the chart—specifically the $103,600 zone. This level served as resistance earlier in the year and is now acting as a critical demand area during this consolidation phase. A daily or 3-day close below this threshold could signal further downside and open the door for a retest of the $100,000 psychological support.
The chart shows lower highs forming since the $112,000 all-time high, which, if continued, may form a descending triangle structure—typically a bearish continuation pattern. Price rejection around $109,300 confirms that sellers remain in control at higher levels. Volume is slightly elevated on red candles, suggesting increased distribution.
The 50 and 100 moving averages (at approximately $94,700 and $87,500, respectively) remain well below the current price, indicating room for further retracement if bearish momentum builds. Still, the broader uptrend remains intact unless price decisively breaks below the $100,000 level.
Bulls need to reclaim $106,500 and close above $109,300 to signal strength. Until then, Bitcoin appears locked in a tightening range, with downside risk increasing in the short term.

Bitcoin keeps breaking records, but it is now the market’s backstage that is drawing attention. While its price approaches all-time highs, another figure is alarming the counters: 96 billion dollars of open interest on derivatives. This data, as fascinating as it is worrying, raises a simple but crucial question: is leverage propelling bitcoin… or preparing its fall?
Bitcoin flirts once again with its historical highs, and this time, the fuel does not come solely from spot demand or freshly launched ETFs. No, the real driver is elsewhere: in the 96 billion dollars of open interest on derivatives linked to bitcoin.
This staggering figure reflects investors’ growing appetite for leveraged contracts. On the surface, it seems like an unrelenting bullish signal. But beneath lies a far more worrisome complexity.
Since the explosion of spot ETFs in January 2024, leveraged positions have taken on an almost structural dimension in the bitcoin market. The realized leverage capitalization today reaches 10.2%, a level among the most extreme since 2018.
This phenomenon is no coincidence: as BTC price moves within the range of 100,000 to 110,000 dollars, every market move is amplified by increasing leverage, creating an environment as explosive as it is fascinating.
Those who remember the 2021 crash know the refrain: euphoria, exaggeration, liquidation. History could well repeat itself. Cascading liquidations remain a tangible risk. A single spark is enough for the house of cards to collapse.
Leverage in crypto markets acts as a double-edged sword. On one side, it boosts returns and accelerates bullish breakouts. In May 2025, Binance recorded a monthly record of 1.7 trillion dollars in futures volume. A speculative frenzy rarely seen before. But this extreme level of commitment comes with an equally exceptional fragility.
When margins become too tight, the sideways movements of bitcoin, like those observed for more than a month above 100,000 dollars, turn into powder kegs.
Short and long positions neutralize each other, but a single sudden deviation in either direction is enough to trigger an avalanche of liquidations. This could propel bitcoin beyond 111,800 dollars… or send it into free fall, dragging down overly exposed traders.
However, a structural change slightly eases this tension: the dominance of stablecoins as margin collateral. Since the collapse of FTX, traders prefer collateral in stable assets over volatile cryptocurrencies. This evolution helps smooth brutal volatility. But let’s be clear: it mitigates, without eliminating, the systemic risk inherent to massive leverage.
In this highly tense environment, another phenomenon deserves attention: the behavior of major players. While retail traders scramble within a narrow range, the strong hands observe.
These institutions and funds with an informational advantage seem to be quietly accumulating. The longs/shorts ratio remains balanced, but the increase in short positions in this price zone suggests the market might be ripe for a brutal “short squeeze.”
As always in derivative markets, it is not declared intentions that matter, but actual positions. And these show that bitcoin has entered a phase of extreme tension: a precarious balance between bullish euphoria and threat of rapid disintegration.
Ultimately, the 96 billion dollars of open interest are neither a simple bullish signal nor an isolated bearish warning. They are both. Bitcoin dances on the edge of the precipice, propelled by leverage that, if skillfully used, can open the way to new highs. But if it turns against it, the backlash could be violent, swift, and spectacular.

And the next big milestone on everyone’s radar is $120K.
With fresh rate-cut rumors swirling around the Federal Reserve, the setup for a continued rally is starting to look eerily perfect.
But while Bitcoin steals the spotlight, the real hidden gem might be quietly building in the background.
Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a lightning-fast, Solana-compatible Layer-2 designed to scale $BTC – and it might just be the infrastructure play of this bull run.
There’s a storm of macro news brewing – and surprisingly, it’s bullish for crypto.
The Federal Reserve, after months of playing hardball on inflation, may finally be loosening its grip. Recent comments from Fed officials and fresh rate-cut speculation for July have markets buzzing.
The reason? A double-whammy of war tensions and trade tariffs could drag down global growth, forcing the Fed to pivot.
Historically, rate cuts weaken the dollar and light a fire under risk assets. And Bitcoin, being the king of risk-on trades, thrives on this kind of chaos.
But what happens when Bitcoin actually starts running again?
Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the Layer-2 solution that finally gives Bitcoin its long-overdue upgrade.
Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it’s not a sidechain or half-measure – it’s a fully operational blockchain engineered to scale Bitcoin in a way that actually works.
For the first time, developers, degens, and builders can create lightning-fast, low-cost dApps directly on the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Think of it like this: Bitcoin is the vault. Bitcoin Hyper is the high-speed highway connected to it – one that unlocks sub-second transaction speeds and near-zero gas fees.
It’s the first real execution layer for Bitcoin, turning it from a passive store of value into an active financial playground. Now, Bitcoin can support payments, meme coins, NFTs, DAOs, and DeFi – all under one roof.
With the Fed hinting at a rate cut, the timing couldn’t be better. If Bitcoin surges, the infrastructure around it, especially one this fast and meme-ready, could take off even faster.
At just $0.011975, Bitcoin Hyper is still in presale, but it’s not going unnoticed. This new crypto project has already raised over $1.4M, and that early-stage window is closing fast.

Analysts predict $HYPER could hit as high as $0.32 by the end of 2025. That’s a potential 2,570% increase from today’s presale price. Let’s do the math.
Say you buy $1K worth of $HYPER at the current price. You’d get roughly 83,5K tokens. Bitcoin Hyper plans to offer staking with competitive APYs. Let’s go with a modest estimate of 20% APY.
Stake those tokens for a year, and you’d earn an extra 16,7K tokens, bringing your total to 100,2K $HYPER.
And that’s not counting early access to token launches, staking pools, governance, and other utility perks presale buyers get.
This is how early plays turn into power positions. With $BTC momentum climbing, $HYPER could be one of the best altcoins to ride this wave.
With the Fed pivot in sight and Bitcoin heating up, the next bull run isn’t a matter of if – it’s when. But when the market takes off, it’s not just $BTC that flies. It’s the infrastructure around it.
That’s where Bitcoin Hyper shines. It’s not trying to replace Bitcoin, it’s here to power the ecosystem with real speed, real apps, and real scalability. While others chase hype, $HYPER is laying the foundation.
And when the market stampede begins, the ones who build the rails get there first.

				As a crypto writer, Bogdan’s responsibilities are split between researching and writing articles and entertaining the team with his humor bordering on the politically incorrect, an aspiring Bill Burr, if you will.

Thanks to his 12+ years of writing experience in just as many fields, including tech, cybersecurity, modelling, fitness, crypto, and other topics-that-shall-not-be-named, he's become a genuine asset to the team.

While his position as a senior writer at PrivacyAffairs thought him valuable lessons about the power of self-management, his entire writing career was and is an exercise in self-improvement.

Now, he's ready to sink his teeth into crypto and teach people how to take control of their own money on the blockchain. With fiat as an eternally devaluing currency, Bitcoin and altcoins seem like the best-fitting alternative for Bogdan.

Bogdan’s biggest professional accomplishment, aside from securing a position as a main writer for Bitcoinist, was his 5-year run as a writing manager at Blackwood Productions, where he coordinated a team of four writers.

During that time, he learned the value of teamwork and that of creating a working environment that breeds efficiency, positivity, and friendship.

This result is significant not only from a numerical standpoint but also because it further consolidates Bitcoin’s central role in the global financial market. 
However, it is interesting to note that compared to the euro Bitcoin has not yet reached new all-time highs, due to the recent appreciation of the European currency against the dollar, linked to global macroeconomic dynamics.
Summary
After a relatively stable period that suggested a possible phase of consolidation, the recent surge of Bitcoin has surprised many analysts. Among the factors that have supported this growth are the persistent global economic uncertainty (which drives investors towards alternative safe-haven assets), the growing interest of traditional financial institutions (which lends credibility and solidity to Bitcoin), and the increasing number of companies that, following the example of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), have decided to adopt Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, among which stand out Tesla, Square, Marathon Digital Holdings, and GameStop. 
To these elements is added the renewed enthusiasm of small retail investors, who often anticipate or amplify market trends, but above all the fact that the total capitalization of Bitcoin has exceeded 2.1 trillion dollars, placing it in 7th place among the most capitalized assets in the world.
In the face of this scenario, a crucial question arises spontaneously: how long will this rise last and what factors will determine the future direction of the price of BTC? This article will attempt to examine the main reasons behind the recent rally, market reactions, and possible developments for the coming months.
Experts’ analysis: bull scenarios and caution signals
The record performances of Bitcoin have divided analysts into two main schools of thought. On one side, there are the more optimistic ones who foresee further significant rises, hypothesizing values even exceeding 250,000 dollars by the end of the year. Among the reasons for this positive outlook are the growing adoption by institutional investors, the spread of new financial instruments linked to Bitcoin, such as ETFs and structured funds, and increasingly clear and favorable regulations for investment in the crypto world.
On the other hand, there are those who instead urge caution, highlighting significant similarities between the current price trend and that observed in the last quarter of 2021, just before the crash of over 70% that occurred in 2022. According to this more cautious perspective, the market could soon face an important correction.
Despite these differences in viewpoints, analysts agree on the importance of monitoring certain key technical levels, such as the psychological threshold of 120,000 dollars, whose breakthrough or rejection could clearly indicate the future direction of the market. Other fundamental elements are global monetary policies, international regulations, and the emotional sentiment of investors, which has always been a decisive element in bull peaks and bear corrections.
If we want to make predictions, there are several approaches that can give an idea of the potential price development in the coming months. Taking for example the predictive charts provided by Bitbo.io, in Figure 2 you can see the forecast for the end of 2025 based on 4 different price models. This forecast ranges between $99,836 and $367,275, a rather wide range but definitely bull-oriented compared to the current price of about $107,000.
Another interesting chart is the one in Figure 3, which shows the trend of Bitcoin’s price in the various “eras” (defined as 700 days before and after each Halving) relative to the minimum of the era itself. It can be seen how the bull markets have always started several weeks after the completion of a Halving (day 0), and how in the current era, the fourth, there is still room for a potential rise towards new highs.
On the other hand, an important aspect that emerges from this chart is related to how the various bull markets of Bitcoin from the first to the third era have occurred with increasingly smaller multiples compared to the cycle’s minimum, demonstrating how Bitcoin has matured over time, reducing its volatility. This could therefore suggest that even if there will be a new high in this era, it will not be as striking as in the past.
Despite the current positive climate, it is crucial for investors to also consider the potential risks that could influence the price of Bitcoin in the near future.
A primary challenge concerns the regulatory response of global financial authorities. A growing institutional interest could lead to greater regulatory scrutiny, creating temporary volatility and uncertainty in the markets. However, clear and adequate regulations could at the same time promote greater price stability and confidence from investors in general.
Another relevant aspect concerns the global economic trend. If so far economic uncertainty has favored Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset, leading it to be defined as the digital equivalent of gold, any sudden changes in the monetary policies of major central banks could trigger profit-taking and sudden corrections.
The psychological factor of investors remains crucial. Despite the record price of Bitcoin, the data related to the search trends of the word Bitcoin on Google still show relatively low levels compared to previous price peaks, indicating that the market may not have yet reached the phase of generalized euphoria. This element suggests that there might still be room for further bull runs from now until the end of 2025.
The recent highs reached by Bitcoin confirm its central role in the financial markets, outlining promising prospects for further price increases. The growing institutional interest, economic uncertainty, and a possible clearer regulation represent crucial factors for further positive developments.
However, especially for short-term investors, it is important to remain cautious and attentive to the risks associated with market volatility. For a correct assessment of future developments, it is crucial to monitor the international regulatory evolution, the strategies of major financial institutions and leading companies holding bitcoin, the decisions of central banks, and market sentiment.
As always, navigating with caution and awareness will remain essential to make the most of the opportunities offered by the crypto market in the months to come.
Greetings and good trading!

The cryptocurrency market is abuzz with contrasting opinions following a volatile trading session on Friday, which pulled down Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and eventually the whole crypto market, following a colossal sell-off. With the market sentiment and most technical analysis being refreshed, crypto traders and analysts are split on divided speculations about whether the digital asset has reached its peak or is poised for further gains. 
Yet, the market took a hit on Friday, with Bitcoin dropping approximately 5% amid profit-taking and macroeconomic uncertainty. Sentiment analysis from Santiment, conducted on June 20, 2025, revealed a near-even split in social media attitudes—1.03 bullish comments for every bearish one—indicating a market at a crossroads. This ambivalence contrasts with the bullish narrative, suggesting potential for either a sustained rally or a correction. 
A notable post by crypto trader CryptoFella on X shares that despite Friday’s shakeout, Bitcoin’s upward trajectory remains intact. In a “zoomed out” frame, CryptoFella’s chart shows close to no dip in Bitcoin price.
$BTC – #Bitcoin: Watch me do it. The top for $BTC is not in yet, simple as that. pic.twitter.com/N4dMF4z3eo
The chart, highlighting a breakout above previous resistance levels, aligns with a drastic surge in 24-hour trading volume on major crypto exchanges. Crypto Fella boldly asserted, “The top for $BTC is not in yet, simple as that,” pointing to historical patterns like the late 2020 rally, when Bitcoin soared from $19,000 to over $60,000 in months. 
Agreeing with this view, several Bitcoin enthusiasts are holding onto hope despite the cryptocurrency trading below its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and outside an upward trending channel, as noted by analyst Josh Mandell. 
Yes, I see that BTC is trading below the 50 Day SMA and outside my upward trending channel but I still believe we close the month green.   She may feel like she's breaking up Captain, but I think she'll hold. pic.twitter.com/d0uXipyNXn
Mandell remains bullish, predicting a green close for the month, even as the market shows signs of strain. The sentiment echoes amid geopolitical uncertainties, with mentions of potential Iran-US negotiations possibly influencing market dynamics, as suggested in related online discussions. 
Meanwhile, Fundstrat’s Mark Newton, a veteran with over 25 years in finance, has identified a critical support level at $102,800, offering a cautious counterpoint to the optimism as traders watch for a potential rebound.
Technical indicators present a mixed picture as Bitcoin’s medium- to long-term outlook seems “slightly negative,” largely due to a break below a rising trend channel and negative volume balance, where sellers appear more aggressive. Conversely, short-term signals remain positive, with the currency showing resilience. 
The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, updated recently, hovers in the “Neutral” zone, reflecting investor caution after the Friday dump.
Industry experts caution that Bitcoin’s volatility, historically driven by sentiment and trading volume, could likely amplify a downtrend. However, a strong long-term cointegration between Bitcoin’s price and trade volume might sustain buying pressure and propel further gains—given that the current uncertainty resolves in favor of optimism. 
As the weekend unfolds, traders are closely monitoring key support levels around $100K–$102K for the Bitcoin price, with many eyeing the next breakout as a litmus test for recent predictions. For now, the market remains a battleground of hope and hesitation, with Bitcoin’s next move hanging in the balance.

Even though the did not make any Ethereum (or even Bitcoin) price forecasts this time, he still mentioned that both these top cryptocurrencies are worth holding.
“HODL $BTC $ETH,” he tweeted, stating that their “usefulness growing in 2025 = good.”
Bitcoin and ethereum usefulness growing in 2025 = good
HODL$BTC $ETH https://t.co/GXR55WrQcM
Earlier this year, during his appearance at CNBC’s Squawk Box show, Lee shared his expectation, saying that Bitcoin could skyrocket as high as $3 million per coin in the long-term due to a large demand versus supply imbalance.
He pointed out that roughly 95% of all Bitcoin out of the 21,000,000 supply has been mined already, but a lot of retail and institutional buyers still want to accumulate BTC. As for Ethereum, Lee’s comment is likely connected to the recent passage of the so-called “Genius Act” regarding stablecoin regulation. The majority of stablecoins are launched on the Ethereum blockchain, which raises its utility.
Over the last week, Bitcoin has staged a decline of approximately 4.87%, crashing from $108,850 to the $103,500 level, where it is changing hands at the time of this writing. The fall continues after the Wednesday announcement of the Fed Reserve’s chairman, Jerome Powell, to keep the interest rates unchanged and also due to the military escalations in the Middle East that have been going for a week already.
Ethereum is down 9.24% since Monday and has displayed a decline of 15.41% since June 12, having lost $2,868. At press time, it is trading at $2,427.

The rise of Bitcoin ETFs continues at a frantic pace. Through its IBIT fund, BlackRock has just taken over more than 3.25% of the circulating supply of BTC. This strengthens its grip on the market. More details in the paragraphs below!
YES! In less than 18 months, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF has become a key player in the market. With $69.7 billion in assets under management, it now holds more than half of the US Bitcoin ETF market share. This represents exactly 54.7%.
According to data, this figure alone represents 3.25% of all bitcoin in circulation. This illustrates a strategic accumulation by institutional investors.
BlackRock’s fund thus ranks 23rd globally among ETFs, across all sectors. This performance is supported by massive institutional flows. We refer to the $388 million of BTC that flowed into American ETFs in a single day. This marks eight consecutive sessions of positive inflows. Proof of growing interest in index funds backed by digital assets!
While Bitcoin ETFs record record volumes, the market structure is evolving. According to Glassnode, 89% of transactions on the Bitcoin network exceed $100,000. This proves that major investors now dictate the rules of the game. The average volume per transaction reaches $36,200, and small holders are becoming rare.
Another fact revealed by CryptoQuant: the cohort of short-term holders has gone from 5.3 to 4.5 million BTC in less than a month. This drop of 800,000 BTC highlights a slowdown in retail activity.
If this trend continues, the next major support could be around $92,000. This corresponds to the realized price level of traders.
The market thus seems to be entering an era where ETFs and institutions take over from individuals. If a new catalyst emerges, the rise in demand could push bitcoin into a new sustainable bull market.

Recent data from Glassnode highlights a sharp drop in daily transaction counts, pointing to the lowest network usage since late 2023.
This trend contrasts with Bitcoin’s bullish momentum, which earlier saw it cross the $111,000 mark last month, reflecting a disconnect between price action and underlying blockchain activity.
A majority of the transaction decline stems from a decrease in non-monetary uses such as Inscriptions and Runes. These features contributed to higher on-chain traffic during the last cycle but have since waned.
Transaction throughput peaked in 2024 at over 734,000 daily transactions but has now fallen to a range between 320,000 and 500,000 per day, Glassnode reported on June 19. Despite this decline in raw transaction volume, other metrics point to shifting dynamics beneath the surface.
According to Glassnode, the decline in transaction count is accompanied by a sharp increase in average transaction size. Large holders, including institutions and high-net-worth individuals, are increasingly utilizing the Bitcoin base layer for significant value transfers.
An average of $7.5 billion is being settled daily on the Bitcoin blockchain, with a recorded peak of $16 billion during the all-time high price breakout in November 2024. Presently, the average volume per transaction sits at $36,200.
Transactions exceeding $100,000 now account for 89% of total volume, up from 66% in late 2022. Meanwhile, smaller transfers under $100,000 have shrunk to just 11% of total volume, down from 34% over the same period.
Glassnode interprets this trend as evidence of growing whale dominance on-chain, even as smaller investor activity shifts elsewhere. The firm also noted that miner revenue from transaction fees has dropped significantly, now sitting around $500,000 daily, one of the lowest levels observed in the past 18 months.
As on-chain usage declines, trading activity has increasingly migrated to off-chain venues, particularly centralized exchanges. Glassnode notes that the futures market alone averaged $57 billion in daily volume over the past year, peaking at $122 billion.
In contrast, spot trading volumes remain considerably lower, averaging $10 billion per day with a peak at $23 billion. Collectively, off-chain activity now exceeds on-chain volume by a factor of seven to sixteen.
The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States in early 2024 has likely contributed to this trend. Glassnode also observed that leverage across derivatives markets has expanded, with total open interest in Bitcoin futures and options reaching $96 billion, a nearly nine-fold increase from 2020 levels.
Importantly, stablecoins have increasingly replaced crypto assets as collateral, particularly following the collapse of FTX. The Glassnode analysts view this as an evolution toward a more mature risk-managed structure in crypto finance.

Bitcoin has surged over the last year, helped by U.S. president Donald Trump’s prediction that “massive” bitcoin and crypto investment is coming.
Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""
The bitcoin price, up around 50% since plummeting to April lows, has found a floor at $100,000 despite a surprise “big risk” recently emerging.
Now, after the U.S. Senate passed a crypto bill predicted to “unleash trillions,” the bitcoin price is braced for a Federal Reserve earthquake after Trump renewed his attack on chair Jerome Powell over interest rates as U.S. debt tops $37 trillion.

Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is under fire from U.S. president Donald Trump—with the bitcoin ... More price predicted to benefit if the Fed flips dovish.
""I don’t know why the board doesn’t override (Powell),"" Trump posted to his Truth Social account in a lengthy message in which he branded Powell a “moron"" and heavily criticized Fed policy that he claims is costing the U.S. $1 trillion per year in interest payments. ""Maybe, just maybe, I’ll have to change my mind about firing him? But regardless, his term ends shortly.""
U.S. debt has skyrocketed in recent years following huge government spending through the Covid-era and lockdowns, with interest rates that were rapidly hiked to rein in inflation adding to the cost of servicing the ballooning $37 trillion U.S. debt pile.
Earlier this month, Trump confirmed a decision on the next Federal Reserve chair will be coming out “ very soon,” after earlier warning he was considering firing Powell if rates weren’t brought down.
Trump also called Powell a “numbskull,"" adding: “I fully understand that my strong criticism of him makes it more difficult for him to do what he should be doing, lowering rates, but I’ve tried it all different ways. I’ve been nice, I’ve been neutral, and I’ve been nasty, and nice and neutral didn’t work!”
This week, the Fed kept interest rates on hold again after kicking of a reduction cycle in September that’s been put on pause due to fears Trump’s global trade tariffs could see a return of inflation.
However, Fed governor Christopher Waller has said he doesn’t expect Trump’s tariffs to drive inflation higher so policymakers should be looking to lower interest rates as early as July.
“If you’re starting to worry about the downside risk [to the] labor market, move now, don’t wait,” Waller told CNBC. The futures market currently puts the chances of a Fed rate cut in July at just 10%, according to CME FedWatch.
Lower interest rates are generally believed to be supportive of risk assets like bitcoin, crypto and high-growth technology stocks as money more easily flows though the economic system, with bitcoin price and crypto analysts predicting a bitcoin price boom if the Fed moves to rapidly reduce rates.

The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year, with U.S. president Donald Trump boosting ... More the bitcoin price and wider crypto market.
The “dot plot from the Federal Reserve was somewhat of a relief, with projections of two rate cuts this year alleviating fears of no more cuts at all in 2025,” Elliot Johnson, chief executive of the Bitcoin Treasury Corporation, said in emailed comments.
“But beyond this short-term noise, there are even more reasons to be optimistic. Bitcoin’s recent strength isn’t only a testament to its resilience or its growing appeal as a safe-haven asset, but also its growing importance as an alternative to the devaluing U.S. dollar and a legitimate long-term treasury asset.”
Others have pointed to bitcoin’s price performance through recent market volatility as helping to establish it as a safe-haven similar to gold.
“As confidence in a perfectly engineered ""soft landing"" wanes, and as global financial currents diverge, bitcoin’s fundamental properties—its scarcity, decentralization, and neutrality—make it an increasingly relevant and compelling asset for investors navigating an uncertain future,"" David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at 21Shares, said via email.
“Bitcoin has firmly cemented itself above $100,000, and its resilience amid geopolitical shocks demonstrates its widespread adoption and developing investment case.”

Now, crypto analyst Colin has indicated that the flagship crypto could still drop to as low as $92,800 and revealed what will happen if BTC gets there. 
The Current Bitcoin Price Action And What To Expect
In an X post, Colin said that it looks increasingly likely that the Bitcoin price will see a retest of at least 100,800 as the first major level of support. The analyst made this statement as BTC dropped out of a bullish pennant for a second time. The measured target for this bull pennant is $150,000. 
However, with the most recent breakdown, the Bitcoin price threatens to decline further before any potential move to the upside. Colin stated that the next major levels below $100,800 are $97,600 and $92,800. He opined that BTC is likely to quickly rebound from these support levels if it gets there. 
The crypto analyst remarked that this Bitcoin price movement is all possible within the confines of the right shoulder of the larger inverse Head-and-Shoulders pattern. He added that this can make the right shoulder more complete, basically on the same level as the left shoulder. This analysis comes just a day after Colin revealed that BTC has deviated from the global M2 money supply. 
However, he suggested that the BTC bull market is far from over. The analyst noted that the deviation happens 20% of the time and doesn’t invalidate the macro trend. Basically, the Bitcoin price is primed to rally higher at some point and possibly reach the $150,000 measured target. Market expert Raoul Pal also commented on BTC’s correlation with the money supply, stating that it shows that there is no need to worry about the current price action. 
Bulls Need To Step In For BTC
In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto stated that the Bulls need to step in now for the Bitcoin price. He noted that BTC is facing a key test, having just been rejected at the Fair Value Gap at around $106,000. The analyst added that the flagship crypto is now retesting the lower boundary of the symmetrical triangle. 
Titan of Crypto stated that if this lower boundary at around $104,000 fails, then the next level would be the previous weekly low at $102,679. If the Bitcoin price fails to hold that level, it could further drop to the liquidity pocket near $100,300. 
At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $103,500, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bulls have failed to keep the market green at the beginning of the weekend, according to CoinStats.
The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped by almost 2% since yesterday.
Despite today's decline, the rate of the main crypto is looking bullish on the hourly chart. If a breakout of the local resistance happens, the growth may continue to the $105,000 area.
From the midterm point of view, the picture is less clear.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction for June 20

ByDenys Serhiichuk




The volume remains low, which means traders are unlikely to witness sharp moves from BTC over the next few days.
From the midterm point of view, the price is on the way to the support of $100,764. If bulls lose that mark, the accumulated energy might be enough for a test of the $98,000-$100,000 range soon.
Bitcoin is trading at $103,940 at press time.

That's the message from an options-based strategy called 25-delta risk reversal, which involves the simultaneous purchase of a put option and sale of a call, or vice versa.
At the time of writing, risk reversals based on Deribit-listed bitcoin and ether options indicated that investors were positioning for downside volatility over the summer.
BTC's 25-delta risk reversals for June, July, and August tenors were negative, indicating a preference for put options, which offer downside protection, over calls or bullish bets, according to data source Amberdata. In ETH's case, puts were pricier out to the July end expiry.
Traders typically buy put options to hedge their long positions in the spot and futures markets, protecting themselves from potential price declines.
""Risk reversals in both BTC and ETH continue to show a preference for downside protection across June and September tenors. This suggests that long holders are actively hedging spot exposure and preparing for potential drawdowns,"" Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a market note.
The nervousness is evident from the over-the-counter liquidity platform Paradigm, where the top five BTC trades for the week include a put spread and a bearish risk reversal. Meanwhile, in ETH's case, a long position in the $2,450 put crossed the tape alongside a short strangle (volatility) trade.
Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has spent over 40 days trading back and forth above $100,000, according to CoinDesk data. According to analysts, profit-taking by long-term holders and miner selling have counteracted the strong uptake for spot ETFs, leaving prices directionless.
""Bitcoin has recently tracked sideways, suggesting its current price may be too high for many retail investors. Open interest in BTC options has risen, with a positive and rising 25 delta put-call skew on 30-day contracts, which may imply that market participants are seeking short-term protection through put options,"" Coinbase Institutional's weekly report noted.
On Friday, BTC closed (UTC) below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) to trade below the key support for the first time since mid-April. The breakdown may lead to more chart-driven selling, potentially resulting in a drop below $100,000.
Some observers, however, expect a rally to new record highs. According to market observer Cas Abbé, BTC's on-balance volume continues to indicate strong buying pressure, suggesting that prices could rise to $130,000-$135,000 by the end of the third quarter.

The asset is hovering near $103,700 following a volatile 24-hour stretch, in which it briefly dropped below $103,400 before staging a modest recovery, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. This price behavior reflects an uneasy market backdrop, shaped by both geopolitical tensions and uncertain monetary policy.
According to an X post by crypto analytics firm Santiment on Thursday, sentiment among retail investors has turned sharply negative. The firm reported that the ratio of bullish to bearish commentary has fallen to just 1.03 to 1 — the lowest since early April, when the President Donald Trump unveiled his so-called Liberation Day tariffs, triggering peak market fear at the time. 
Santiment emphasized that this current wave of retail pessimism is unusually intense and, based on past patterns, may mark a contrarian signal for a price rebound. They specifically noted that back in April, Bitcoin rallied shortly after similar fear levels surfaced, suggesting large investors often use periods of retail capitulation to accumulate at favorable prices.
Adding to the pressure is the Federal Reserve's recent decision to hold interest rates steady, which has kept btcoin trading in a relatively tight $100,000 to $110,000 range over the past month. Meanwhile, on-chain metrics show declining open interest on Binance, pointing to continued deleveraging among derivatives traders. At the same time, whale wallets have shown steady accumulation since 2023 — an indication that large holders are continuing to build their positions despite the short-term uncertainty.

As geopolitical tensions intensify and investor sentiment deteriorates, bearish pressure has continued spreading across Bitcoin’s spot and derivatives markets. 
The uncertainty surrounding global macroeconomic stability has led many market participants to take a risk-off approach, with the coin showing signs of vulnerability as the second quarter draws to a close.
With the coin struggling to rally momentum around the $103,000 price mark, Bitcoin futures traders have increasingly positioned against the coin. 
According to Coinglass, the coin’s long/short ratio — a key measure of trader sentiment — has tilted heavily toward shorts since June 17, indicating a growing belief that BTC’s recent rally may be losing momentum. At press time, the ratio is 0.95, indicating more traders are betting against the altcoin. 
This ratio compares the number of long and short positions in a market. When an asset’s long/short ratio is above 1, there are more long than short positions, indicating that traders are predominantly betting on a price increase.
Conversely, as seen with BTC, a ratio below one indicates that most traders are positioning for a price drop. This reflects heightened bearish sentiment and growing expectations of continued downside movements in the short term.
Moreover, daily chart readings from BTC’s BBTrend indicator reinforce the bearish outlook. As BTC’s price momentum weakens, the green histogram bars on the indicator have steadily fallen in size, signaling a decline in buying pressure and a loss of bullish strength.
The BBTrend is used to gauge the strength and direction of price trends. It appears as histogram bars — green when the trend is bullish and red when bearish. 
When the BBTrend turns negative or the green bars shrink, upward momentum is fading, and the asset may be entering a consolidation phase or facing a reversal. 
A consistently negative BBTrend suggests that selling pressure is dominating, increasing the likelihood of an extended price correction for BTC.
Yesterday, BTC’s price fell to a 15-day low of $102,345. Although it rebounded and closed at $103,297, bearish pressure remains, with the coin still down 2% over the past 24 hours.
If new demand continues to be limited, BTC’s price could extend its dip toward $101,520. Should the bulls fail to defend this critical support level, the asset could plunge further to $97,658.
On the other hand, if buying pressure strengthens, BTC could rebound and attempt a break above $103,952. A successful move past this level may open the door for a rally toward $106,295.

Industry commentators are debating which asset, XRP or Bitcoin, offers a better investment opportunity at current price levels.
Leading the conversation is Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy. He suggests that XRP presents a more attractive risk-reward profile in the current market cycle. According to him, XRP’s price potential remains conservative and realistic compared to Bitcoin trading above $100,000.
“You’d have to be insane to think Bitcoin at $106K is a better investment than XRP,” he said.
Notably, XRP is trading around $2. Farina’s statement implies that the coin could outperform and deliver greater returns than Bitcoin, which is already in the six-figure price range.
Farina points to previous market conditions, such as when XRP was $0.50 while Bitcoin traded at $70,000 in 2024. From that range, XRP went on to reach $3.40, offering approximately a 7X return for holders.
To put it in perspective: 100,000 XRP tokens purchased at $0.50 in November 2024 for $50,000 would have grown to $340,000 by January 2025. With XRP’s current price at $2.10, the asset still holds over 4X gains for those investors.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin rose from about $68,000 during the same period to a new all-time high of approximately $112,000. This amounted to a 64% gain, whereas XRP delivered nearly ten times more. For comparison, $50,000 invested in Bitcoin in November 2024 reached a peak value of only around $82,352.
In contrast, the same $50,000 invested in XRP grew to $340,000. Given this significant performance gap, XRP proponents continue to advocate for the asset over Bitcoin.
One commenter responding to Farina’s post emphasized that the conversation isn’t about being anti-Bitcoin, but about recognizing asymmetric opportunities. 
With XRP at $2, they argued that even a move to $5 or $10 would represent significant upside in multiples higher than what Bitcoin could realistically achieve from its current position.
Another user highlighted the limitations of average retail investors, noting that most people don’t have $10,000 to invest in Bitcoin, let alone expect it to multiply several times over. 
They argued that allocating such capital to XRP makes more sense from a return-on-investment perspective. At current prices, $10,000 would buy only about 0.09 BTC, which would return $47,000 if Bitcoin hit $500,000, a scenario they called a “big if.” 
By contrast, XRP offers significantly higher ROI potential for the same investment, in their view. Farina agrees with this perspective. 
In a previous commentary, he boldly asserted that if Bitcoin rose to $500,000, XRP could soar to $100. In that case, Bitcoin would deliver a 5X gain for holders, while XRP would yield over 40X.
However, critics are challenging the pro-XRP narrative against Bitcoin. One commenter questioned the comparison by highlighting XRP’s historical performance.
Specifically, they noted that while Bitcoin has risen from $20,000 to over $112,000 since its 2017–2018 highs, XRP has still not returned to its previous all-time high from the same period. 
This challenges the assumption that XRP’s lower price relative to Bitcoin means it will necessarily perform better in the future, particularly given XRP’s long-standing historical underperformance.

Sellers are stepping in at key supply zones, pushing back against attempts to enter price discovery above the $112K all-time high. Despite this pressure, Bitcoin remains resilient above the psychologically significant $100K mark, where it has found support since early June.
The latest on-chain data from Gemini and Glassnode reveals a noteworthy structural shift: over 30% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply is now held by just 216 centralized entities. These include exchanges, ETFs, funds, public and private companies, DeFi contracts, and even governments. Exchanges currently hold the largest share, while public companies represent the most numerous holders. This trend highlights the deepening custodial centralization of Bitcoin, raising both adoption optimism and decentralization concerns.
As the macroeconomic backdrop remains volatile—with high US Treasury yields, the Fed holding interest rates, and geopolitical tensions intensifying—Bitcoin’s price action is becoming increasingly sensitive to shifts in sentiment and liquidity. Whether BTC can hold this key support or slide deeper into correction will depend on upcoming volume reactions and potential moves from these dominant custodial players.
Bitcoin is currently down 8% from its $112K all-time high, hovering in a broad consolidation phase with no decisive breakout. The price action suggests that the market is at a critical juncture, with traders split between two possibilities: a deeper retracement toward the $94K level or a renewed push into price discovery. This indecision is amplified by ongoing geopolitical tensions, particularly the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Many analysts warn that if the United States steps in, it could trigger panic across global markets, creating spillover effects into the crypto space.
Meanwhile, key insights from Glassnode and Gemini shed light on a growing trend in Bitcoin’s ownership structure. Over 30% of the circulating supply is now held by just 216 centralized entities. This reflects a dual narrative—on one hand, increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve or investment asset, and on the other, rising custodial centralization that may undermine the network’s decentralized ethos.
The largest holdings belong to crypto exchanges, ETFs, and funds, followed by public and private companies that have allocated BTC to their balance sheets. A notable portion is also locked in DeFi contracts, with some controlled by governments following seizures or strategic acquisitions.
While this growing centralization may boost credibility and capital inflow, it also introduces new risks to liquidity and distribution. In such a fragile macro environment, Bitcoin’s next major move will depend not only on technical setups but also on the behavior of these key holders under pressure.
Bitcoin has retraced from its recent local high of $106,500 and is now trading around the $103,100 mark, testing a key support level highlighted in yellow on the chart—specifically the $103,600 zone. This level served as resistance earlier in the year and is now acting as a critical demand area during this consolidation phase. A daily or 3-day close below this threshold could signal further downside and open the door for a retest of the $100,000 psychological support.
The chart shows lower highs forming since the $112,000 all-time high, which, if continued, may form a descending triangle structure—typically a bearish continuation pattern. Price rejection around $109,300 confirms that sellers remain in control at higher levels. Volume is slightly elevated on red candles, suggesting increased distribution.
The 50 and 100 moving averages (at approximately $94,700 and $87,500, respectively) remain well below the current price, indicating room for further retracement if bearish momentum builds. Still, the broader uptrend remains intact unless price decisively breaks below the $100,000 level.
Bulls need to reclaim $106,500 and close above $109,300 to signal strength. Until then, Bitcoin appears locked in a tightening range, with downside risk increasing in the short term.

Bitcoin keeps breaking records, but it is now the market’s backstage that is drawing attention. While its price approaches all-time highs, another figure is alarming the counters: 96 billion dollars of open interest on derivatives. This data, as fascinating as it is worrying, raises a simple but crucial question: is leverage propelling bitcoin… or preparing its fall?
Bitcoin flirts once again with its historical highs, and this time, the fuel does not come solely from spot demand or freshly launched ETFs. No, the real driver is elsewhere: in the 96 billion dollars of open interest on derivatives linked to bitcoin.
This staggering figure reflects investors’ growing appetite for leveraged contracts. On the surface, it seems like an unrelenting bullish signal. But beneath lies a far more worrisome complexity.
Since the explosion of spot ETFs in January 2024, leveraged positions have taken on an almost structural dimension in the bitcoin market. The realized leverage capitalization today reaches 10.2%, a level among the most extreme since 2018.
This phenomenon is no coincidence: as BTC price moves within the range of 100,000 to 110,000 dollars, every market move is amplified by increasing leverage, creating an environment as explosive as it is fascinating.
Those who remember the 2021 crash know the refrain: euphoria, exaggeration, liquidation. History could well repeat itself. Cascading liquidations remain a tangible risk. A single spark is enough for the house of cards to collapse.
Leverage in crypto markets acts as a double-edged sword. On one side, it boosts returns and accelerates bullish breakouts. In May 2025, Binance recorded a monthly record of 1.7 trillion dollars in futures volume. A speculative frenzy rarely seen before. But this extreme level of commitment comes with an equally exceptional fragility.
When margins become too tight, the sideways movements of bitcoin, like those observed for more than a month above 100,000 dollars, turn into powder kegs.
Short and long positions neutralize each other, but a single sudden deviation in either direction is enough to trigger an avalanche of liquidations. This could propel bitcoin beyond 111,800 dollars… or send it into free fall, dragging down overly exposed traders.
However, a structural change slightly eases this tension: the dominance of stablecoins as margin collateral. Since the collapse of FTX, traders prefer collateral in stable assets over volatile cryptocurrencies. This evolution helps smooth brutal volatility. But let’s be clear: it mitigates, without eliminating, the systemic risk inherent to massive leverage.
In this highly tense environment, another phenomenon deserves attention: the behavior of major players. While retail traders scramble within a narrow range, the strong hands observe.
These institutions and funds with an informational advantage seem to be quietly accumulating. The longs/shorts ratio remains balanced, but the increase in short positions in this price zone suggests the market might be ripe for a brutal “short squeeze.”
As always in derivative markets, it is not declared intentions that matter, but actual positions. And these show that bitcoin has entered a phase of extreme tension: a precarious balance between bullish euphoria and threat of rapid disintegration.
Ultimately, the 96 billion dollars of open interest are neither a simple bullish signal nor an isolated bearish warning. They are both. Bitcoin dances on the edge of the precipice, propelled by leverage that, if skillfully used, can open the way to new highs. But if it turns against it, the backlash could be violent, swift, and spectacular.

And the next big milestone on everyone’s radar is $120K.
With fresh rate-cut rumors swirling around the Federal Reserve, the setup for a continued rally is starting to look eerily perfect.
But while Bitcoin steals the spotlight, the real hidden gem might be quietly building in the background.
Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a lightning-fast, Solana-compatible Layer-2 designed to scale $BTC – and it might just be the infrastructure play of this bull run.
There’s a storm of macro news brewing – and surprisingly, it’s bullish for crypto.
The Federal Reserve, after months of playing hardball on inflation, may finally be loosening its grip. Recent comments from Fed officials and fresh rate-cut speculation for July have markets buzzing.
The reason? A double-whammy of war tensions and trade tariffs could drag down global growth, forcing the Fed to pivot.
Historically, rate cuts weaken the dollar and light a fire under risk assets. And Bitcoin, being the king of risk-on trades, thrives on this kind of chaos.
But what happens when Bitcoin actually starts running again?
Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the Layer-2 solution that finally gives Bitcoin its long-overdue upgrade.
Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it’s not a sidechain or half-measure – it’s a fully operational blockchain engineered to scale Bitcoin in a way that actually works.
For the first time, developers, degens, and builders can create lightning-fast, low-cost dApps directly on the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Think of it like this: Bitcoin is the vault. Bitcoin Hyper is the high-speed highway connected to it – one that unlocks sub-second transaction speeds and near-zero gas fees.
It’s the first real execution layer for Bitcoin, turning it from a passive store of value into an active financial playground. Now, Bitcoin can support payments, meme coins, NFTs, DAOs, and DeFi – all under one roof.
With the Fed hinting at a rate cut, the timing couldn’t be better. If Bitcoin surges, the infrastructure around it, especially one this fast and meme-ready, could take off even faster.
At just $0.011975, Bitcoin Hyper is still in presale, but it’s not going unnoticed. This new crypto project has already raised over $1.4M, and that early-stage window is closing fast.

Analysts predict $HYPER could hit as high as $0.32 by the end of 2025. That’s a potential 2,570% increase from today’s presale price. Let’s do the math.
Say you buy $1K worth of $HYPER at the current price. You’d get roughly 83,5K tokens. Bitcoin Hyper plans to offer staking with competitive APYs. Let’s go with a modest estimate of 20% APY.
Stake those tokens for a year, and you’d earn an extra 16,7K tokens, bringing your total to 100,2K $HYPER.
And that’s not counting early access to token launches, staking pools, governance, and other utility perks presale buyers get.
This is how early plays turn into power positions. With $BTC momentum climbing, $HYPER could be one of the best altcoins to ride this wave.
With the Fed pivot in sight and Bitcoin heating up, the next bull run isn’t a matter of if – it’s when. But when the market takes off, it’s not just $BTC that flies. It’s the infrastructure around it.
That’s where Bitcoin Hyper shines. It’s not trying to replace Bitcoin, it’s here to power the ecosystem with real speed, real apps, and real scalability. While others chase hype, $HYPER is laying the foundation.
And when the market stampede begins, the ones who build the rails get there first.

				As a crypto writer, Bogdan’s responsibilities are split between researching and writing articles and entertaining the team with his humor bordering on the politically incorrect, an aspiring Bill Burr, if you will.

Thanks to his 12+ years of writing experience in just as many fields, including tech, cybersecurity, modelling, fitness, crypto, and other topics-that-shall-not-be-named, he's become a genuine asset to the team.

While his position as a senior writer at PrivacyAffairs thought him valuable lessons about the power of self-management, his entire writing career was and is an exercise in self-improvement.

Now, he's ready to sink his teeth into crypto and teach people how to take control of their own money on the blockchain. With fiat as an eternally devaluing currency, Bitcoin and altcoins seem like the best-fitting alternative for Bogdan.

Bogdan’s biggest professional accomplishment, aside from securing a position as a main writer for Bitcoinist, was his 5-year run as a writing manager at Blackwood Productions, where he coordinated a team of four writers.

During that time, he learned the value of teamwork and that of creating a working environment that breeds efficiency, positivity, and friendship.

This result is significant not only from a numerical standpoint but also because it further consolidates Bitcoin’s central role in the global financial market. 
However, it is interesting to note that compared to the euro Bitcoin has not yet reached new all-time highs, due to the recent appreciation of the European currency against the dollar, linked to global macroeconomic dynamics.
Summary
After a relatively stable period that suggested a possible phase of consolidation, the recent surge of Bitcoin has surprised many analysts. Among the factors that have supported this growth are the persistent global economic uncertainty (which drives investors towards alternative safe-haven assets), the growing interest of traditional financial institutions (which lends credibility and solidity to Bitcoin), and the increasing number of companies that, following the example of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), have decided to adopt Bitcoin as a strategic reserve, among which stand out Tesla, Square, Marathon Digital Holdings, and GameStop. 
To these elements is added the renewed enthusiasm of small retail investors, who often anticipate or amplify market trends, but above all the fact that the total capitalization of Bitcoin has exceeded 2.1 trillion dollars, placing it in 7th place among the most capitalized assets in the world.
In the face of this scenario, a crucial question arises spontaneously: how long will this rise last and what factors will determine the future direction of the price of BTC? This article will attempt to examine the main reasons behind the recent rally, market reactions, and possible developments for the coming months.
Experts’ analysis: bull scenarios and caution signals
The record performances of Bitcoin have divided analysts into two main schools of thought. On one side, there are the more optimistic ones who foresee further significant rises, hypothesizing values even exceeding 250,000 dollars by the end of the year. Among the reasons for this positive outlook are the growing adoption by institutional investors, the spread of new financial instruments linked to Bitcoin, such as ETFs and structured funds, and increasingly clear and favorable regulations for investment in the crypto world.
On the other hand, there are those who instead urge caution, highlighting significant similarities between the current price trend and that observed in the last quarter of 2021, just before the crash of over 70% that occurred in 2022. According to this more cautious perspective, the market could soon face an important correction.
Despite these differences in viewpoints, analysts agree on the importance of monitoring certain key technical levels, such as the psychological threshold of 120,000 dollars, whose breakthrough or rejection could clearly indicate the future direction of the market. Other fundamental elements are global monetary policies, international regulations, and the emotional sentiment of investors, which has always been a decisive element in bull peaks and bear corrections.
If we want to make predictions, there are several approaches that can give an idea of the potential price development in the coming months. Taking for example the predictive charts provided by Bitbo.io, in Figure 2 you can see the forecast for the end of 2025 based on 4 different price models. This forecast ranges between $99,836 and $367,275, a rather wide range but definitely bull-oriented compared to the current price of about $107,000.
Another interesting chart is the one in Figure 3, which shows the trend of Bitcoin’s price in the various “eras” (defined as 700 days before and after each Halving) relative to the minimum of the era itself. It can be seen how the bull markets have always started several weeks after the completion of a Halving (day 0), and how in the current era, the fourth, there is still room for a potential rise towards new highs.
On the other hand, an important aspect that emerges from this chart is related to how the various bull markets of Bitcoin from the first to the third era have occurred with increasingly smaller multiples compared to the cycle’s minimum, demonstrating how Bitcoin has matured over time, reducing its volatility. This could therefore suggest that even if there will be a new high in this era, it will not be as striking as in the past.
Despite the current positive climate, it is crucial for investors to also consider the potential risks that could influence the price of Bitcoin in the near future.
A primary challenge concerns the regulatory response of global financial authorities. A growing institutional interest could lead to greater regulatory scrutiny, creating temporary volatility and uncertainty in the markets. However, clear and adequate regulations could at the same time promote greater price stability and confidence from investors in general.
Another relevant aspect concerns the global economic trend. If so far economic uncertainty has favored Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset, leading it to be defined as the digital equivalent of gold, any sudden changes in the monetary policies of major central banks could trigger profit-taking and sudden corrections.
The psychological factor of investors remains crucial. Despite the record price of Bitcoin, the data related to the search trends of the word Bitcoin on Google still show relatively low levels compared to previous price peaks, indicating that the market may not have yet reached the phase of generalized euphoria. This element suggests that there might still be room for further bull runs from now until the end of 2025.
The recent highs reached by Bitcoin confirm its central role in the financial markets, outlining promising prospects for further price increases. The growing institutional interest, economic uncertainty, and a possible clearer regulation represent crucial factors for further positive developments.
However, especially for short-term investors, it is important to remain cautious and attentive to the risks associated with market volatility. For a correct assessment of future developments, it is crucial to monitor the international regulatory evolution, the strategies of major financial institutions and leading companies holding bitcoin, the decisions of central banks, and market sentiment.
As always, navigating with caution and awareness will remain essential to make the most of the opportunities offered by the crypto market in the months to come.

The cryptocurrency market is abuzz with contrasting opinions following a volatile trading session on Friday, which pulled down Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and eventually the whole crypto market, following a colossal sell-off. With the market sentiment and most technical analysis being refreshed, crypto traders and analysts are split on divided speculations about whether the digital asset has reached its peak or is poised for further gains. 
Yet, the market took a hit on Friday, with Bitcoin dropping approximately 5% amid profit-taking and macroeconomic uncertainty. Sentiment analysis from Santiment, conducted on June 20, 2025, revealed a near-even split in social media attitudes—1.03 bullish comments for every bearish one—indicating a market at a crossroads. This ambivalence contrasts with the bullish narrative, suggesting potential for either a sustained rally or a correction. 
A notable post by crypto trader CryptoFella on X shares that despite Friday’s shakeout, Bitcoin’s upward trajectory remains intact. In a “zoomed out” frame, CryptoFella’s chart shows close to no dip in Bitcoin price.
$BTC – #Bitcoin: Watch me do it. The top for $BTC is not in yet, simple as that. pic.twitter.com/N4dMF4z3eo
The chart, highlighting a breakout above previous resistance levels, aligns with a drastic surge in 24-hour trading volume on major crypto exchanges. Crypto Fella boldly asserted, “The top for $BTC is not in yet, simple as that,” pointing to historical patterns like the late 2020 rally, when Bitcoin soared from $19,000 to over $60,000 in months. 
Agreeing with this view, several Bitcoin enthusiasts are holding onto hope despite the cryptocurrency trading below its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and outside an upward trending channel, as noted by analyst Josh Mandell. 
Yes, I see that BTC is trading below the 50 Day SMA and outside my upward trending channel but I still believe we close the month green.   She may feel like she's breaking up Captain, but I think she'll hold. pic.twitter.com/d0uXipyNXn
Mandell remains bullish, predicting a green close for the month, even as the market shows signs of strain. The sentiment echoes amid geopolitical uncertainties, with mentions of potential Iran-US negotiations possibly influencing market dynamics, as suggested in related online discussions. 
Meanwhile, Fundstrat’s Mark Newton, a veteran with over 25 years in finance, has identified a critical support level at $102,800, offering a cautious counterpoint to the optimism as traders watch for a potential rebound.
Technical indicators present a mixed picture as Bitcoin’s medium- to long-term outlook seems “slightly negative,” largely due to a break below a rising trend channel and negative volume balance, where sellers appear more aggressive. Conversely, short-term signals remain positive, with the currency showing resilience. 
The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, updated recently, hovers in the “Neutral” zone, reflecting investor caution after the Friday dump.
Industry experts caution that Bitcoin’s volatility, historically driven by sentiment and trading volume, could likely amplify a downtrend. However, a strong long-term cointegration between Bitcoin’s price and trade volume might sustain buying pressure and propel further gains—given that the current uncertainty resolves in favor of optimism. 
As the weekend unfolds, traders are closely monitoring key support levels around $100K–$102K for the Bitcoin price, with many eyeing the next breakout as a litmus test for recent predictions. For now, the market remains a battleground of hope and hesitation, with Bitcoin’s next move hanging in the balance.

Even though the did not make any Ethereum (or even Bitcoin) price forecasts this time, he still mentioned that both these top cryptocurrencies are worth holding.
“HODL $BTC $ETH,” he tweeted, stating that their “usefulness growing in 2025 = good.”
Bitcoin and ethereum usefulness growing in 2025 = good
HODL$BTC $ETH https://t.co/GXR55WrQcM
Earlier this year, during his appearance at CNBC’s Squawk Box show, Lee shared his expectation, saying that Bitcoin could skyrocket as high as $3 million per coin in the long-term due to a large demand versus supply imbalance.
He pointed out that roughly 95% of all Bitcoin out of the 21,000,000 supply has been mined already, but a lot of retail and institutional buyers still want to accumulate BTC. As for Ethereum, Lee’s comment is likely connected to the recent passage of the so-called “Genius Act” regarding stablecoin regulation. The majority of stablecoins are launched on the Ethereum blockchain, which raises its utility.
Over the last week, Bitcoin has staged a decline of approximately 4.87%, crashing from $108,850 to the $103,500 level, where it is changing hands at the time of this writing. The fall continues after the Wednesday announcement of the Fed Reserve’s chairman, Jerome Powell, to keep the interest rates unchanged and also due to the military escalations in the Middle East that have been going for a week already.
Ethereum is down 9.24% since Monday and has displayed a decline of 15.41% since June 12, having lost $2,868. At press time, it is trading at $2,427.

The rise of Bitcoin ETFs continues at a frantic pace. Through its IBIT fund, BlackRock has just taken over more than 3.25% of the circulating supply of BTC. This strengthens its grip on the market. More details in the paragraphs below!
YES! In less than 18 months, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF has become a key player in the market. With $69.7 billion in assets under management, it now holds more than half of the US Bitcoin ETF market share. This represents exactly 54.7%.
According to data, this figure alone represents 3.25% of all bitcoin in circulation. This illustrates a strategic accumulation by institutional investors.
BlackRock’s fund thus ranks 23rd globally among ETFs, across all sectors. This performance is supported by massive institutional flows. We refer to the $388 million of BTC that flowed into American ETFs in a single day. This marks eight consecutive sessions of positive inflows. Proof of growing interest in index funds backed by digital assets!
While Bitcoin ETFs record record volumes, the market structure is evolving. According to Glassnode, 89% of transactions on the Bitcoin network exceed $100,000. This proves that major investors now dictate the rules of the game. The average volume per transaction reaches $36,200, and small holders are becoming rare.
Another fact revealed by CryptoQuant: the cohort of short-term holders has gone from 5.3 to 4.5 million BTC in less than a month. This drop of 800,000 BTC highlights a slowdown in retail activity.
If this trend continues, the next major support could be around $92,000. This corresponds to the realized price level of traders.
The market thus seems to be entering an era where ETFs and institutions take over from individuals. If a new catalyst emerges, the rise in demand could push bitcoin into a new sustainable bull market.

Recent data from Glassnode highlights a sharp drop in daily transaction counts, pointing to the lowest network usage since late 2023.
This trend contrasts with Bitcoin’s bullish momentum, which earlier saw it cross the $111,000 mark last month, reflecting a disconnect between price action and underlying blockchain activity.
A majority of the transaction decline stems from a decrease in non-monetary uses such as Inscriptions and Runes. These features contributed to higher on-chain traffic during the last cycle but have since waned.
Transaction throughput peaked in 2024 at over 734,000 daily transactions but has now fallen to a range between 320,000 and 500,000 per day, Glassnode reported on June 19. Despite this decline in raw transaction volume, other metrics point to shifting dynamics beneath the surface.
According to Glassnode, the decline in transaction count is accompanied by a sharp increase in average transaction size. Large holders, including institutions and high-net-worth individuals, are increasingly utilizing the Bitcoin base layer for significant value transfers.
An average of $7.5 billion is being settled daily on the Bitcoin blockchain, with a recorded peak of $16 billion during the all-time high price breakout in November 2024. Presently, the average volume per transaction sits at $36,200.
Transactions exceeding $100,000 now account for 89% of total volume, up from 66% in late 2022. Meanwhile, smaller transfers under $100,000 have shrunk to just 11% of total volume, down from 34% over the same period.
Glassnode interprets this trend as evidence of growing whale dominance on-chain, even as smaller investor activity shifts elsewhere. The firm also noted that miner revenue from transaction fees has dropped significantly, now sitting around $500,000 daily, one of the lowest levels observed in the past 18 months.
As on-chain usage declines, trading activity has increasingly migrated to off-chain venues, particularly centralized exchanges. Glassnode notes that the futures market alone averaged $57 billion in daily volume over the past year, peaking at $122 billion.
In contrast, spot trading volumes remain considerably lower, averaging $10 billion per day with a peak at $23 billion. Collectively, off-chain activity now exceeds on-chain volume by a factor of seven to sixteen.
The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States in early 2024 has likely contributed to this trend. Glassnode also observed that leverage across derivatives markets has expanded, with total open interest in Bitcoin futures and options reaching $96 billion, a nearly nine-fold increase from 2020 levels.
Importantly, stablecoins have increasingly replaced crypto assets as collateral, particularly following the collapse of FTX. The Glassnode analysts view this as an evolution toward a more mature risk-managed structure in crypto finance.

Bitcoin has surged over the last year, helped by U.S. president Donald Trump’s prediction that “massive” bitcoin and crypto investment is coming.

The bitcoin price, up around 50% since plummeting to April lows, has found a floor at $100,000 despite a surprise “big risk” recently emerging.
Now, after the U.S. Senate passed a crypto bill predicted to “unleash trillions,” the bitcoin price is braced for a Federal Reserve earthquake after Trump renewed his attack on chair Jerome Powell over interest rates as U.S. debt tops $37 trillion.

Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell is under fire from U.S. president Donald Trump—with the bitcoin ... More price predicted to benefit if the Fed flips dovish.
""I don’t know why the board doesn’t override (Powell),"" Trump posted to his Truth Social account in a lengthy message in which he branded Powell a “moron"" and heavily criticized Fed policy that he claims is costing the U.S. $1 trillion per year in interest payments. ""Maybe, just maybe, I’ll have to change my mind about firing him? But regardless, his term ends shortly.""
U.S. debt has skyrocketed in recent years following huge government spending through the Covid-era and lockdowns, with interest rates that were rapidly hiked to rein in inflation adding to the cost of servicing the ballooning $37 trillion U.S. debt pile.
Earlier this month, Trump confirmed a decision on the next Federal Reserve chair will be coming out “ very soon,” after earlier warning he was considering firing Powell if rates weren’t brought down.
Trump also called Powell a “numbskull,"" adding: “I fully understand that my strong criticism of him makes it more difficult for him to do what he should be doing, lowering rates, but I’ve tried it all different ways. I’ve been nice, I’ve been neutral, and I’ve been nasty, and nice and neutral didn’t work!”
This week, the Fed kept interest rates on hold again after kicking of a reduction cycle in September that’s been put on pause due to fears Trump’s global trade tariffs could see a return of inflation.
However, Fed governor Christopher Waller has said he doesn’t expect Trump’s tariffs to drive inflation higher so policymakers should be looking to lower interest rates as early as July.
“If you’re starting to worry about the downside risk [to the] labor market, move now, don’t wait,” Waller told CNBC. The futures market currently puts the chances of a Fed rate cut in July at just 10%, according to CME FedWatch.
Lower interest rates are generally believed to be supportive of risk assets like bitcoin, crypto and high-growth technology stocks as money more easily flows though the economic system, with bitcoin price and crypto analysts predicting a bitcoin price boom if the Fed moves to rapidly reduce rates.

The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year, with U.S. president Donald Trump boosting ... More the bitcoin price and wider crypto market.
The “dot plot from the Federal Reserve was somewhat of a relief, with projections of two rate cuts this year alleviating fears of no more cuts at all in 2025,” Elliot Johnson, chief executive of the Bitcoin Treasury Corporation, said in emailed comments.
“But beyond this short-term noise, there are even more reasons to be optimistic. Bitcoin’s recent strength isn’t only a testament to its resilience or its growing appeal as a safe-haven asset, but also its growing importance as an alternative to the devaluing U.S. dollar and a legitimate long-term treasury asset.”
Others have pointed to bitcoin’s price performance through recent market volatility as helping to establish it as a safe-haven similar to gold.
“As confidence in a perfectly engineered ""soft landing"" wanes, and as global financial currents diverge, bitcoin’s fundamental properties—its scarcity, decentralization, and neutrality—make it an increasingly relevant and compelling asset for investors navigating an uncertain future,"" David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at 21Shares, said via email.
“Bitcoin has firmly cemented itself above $100,000, and its resilience amid geopolitical shocks demonstrates its widespread adoption and developing investment case.”

Nakamoto Holdings secures $51.5M to expand Bitcoin treasury strategy
Bitcoin holding company Nakamoto Holdings, founded by US President Donald Trump’s crypto adviser, David Bailey, has secured $51.5 million in fresh capital through a private placement in public equity (PIPE) deal, according to a statement from merger partner KindlyMD.
Bailey said that the new funds were raised in less than 72 hours, reflecting growing investor appetite for Nakamoto’s Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation strategy.
“Investor demand for Nakamoto is incredibly strong,” Bailey said. “We continue to execute our strategy to raise as much capital as possible to acquire as much Bitcoin as possible.”
The financing, priced at $5.00 per share, brings KindlyMD’s total funding to approximately $563 million, and $763 million including convertible notes.
CoinMarketCap has 'identified and removed' malicious wallet scam
CoinMarketCap, a price-tracking website for cryptocurrencies, has reportedly removed a malicious popup notification on its website prompting users to verify their cryptocurrency wallets, according to a post on its official X account.
“We’ve identified and removed the malicious code from our site,” CoinMarketCap said in a post on Friday.
“Our team is continuing to investigate and taking steps to strengthen our security,” it added.
The update came less than three hours after CoinMarketCap publicly addressed the malicious notification amid multiple reports spreading on social media.
Wyoming stablecoin commission names Aptos highest-ranking blockchain
The Wyoming Stable Token Commission has shortlisted Aptos and Sei for its stablecoin pilot program, giving Aptos the highest score among the more than 10 blockchains considered for its forthcoming WYST project.
Aptos disclosed Friday that it received the highest marks based on the commission’s network testing, scoring 32 points. Solana received an identical score of 32 points, though it was not selected for the pilot phase.
Sei, meanwhile, scored 30 points, ahead of Avalanche (27), Ethereum (26), Base (25) and Algorand (21), among others.
The network tests evaluated metrics such as transactions per second, fees and transaction finality, as reported by X user Phillip, who is associated with the Sei project.
WYST is Wyoming’s state-backed stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar and developed in collaboration with LayerZero. News of its development emerged in 2023, several months after the Wyoming Stable Token Act was passed.
Wyoming is launching a stablecoin to generate state revenue by earning interest on reserves held in short-duration US Treasury bonds. The initiative also aims to promote financial innovation and enhance transparency.
In March, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon teased that the new stablecoin could launch by July.

Bulls have failed to keep the market green at the beginning of the weekend, according to CoinStats.
The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped by almost 2% since yesterday.
Despite today's decline, the rate of the main crypto is looking bullish on the hourly chart. If a breakout of the local resistance happens, the growth may continue to the $105,000 area.
From the midterm point of view, the picture is less clear.

Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction for June 20

ByDenys Serhiichuk




The volume remains low, which means traders are unlikely to witness sharp moves from BTC over the next few days.
From the midterm point of view, the price is on the way to the support of $100,764. If bulls lose that mark, the accumulated energy might be enough for a test of the $98,000-$100,000 range soon.
Bitcoin is trading at $103,940 at press time.

That's the message from an options-based strategy called 25-delta risk reversal, which involves the simultaneous purchase of a put option and sale of a call, or vice versa.
At the time of writing, risk reversals based on Deribit-listed bitcoin and ether options indicated that investors were positioning for downside volatility over the summer.
BTC's 25-delta risk reversals for June, July, and August tenors were negative, indicating a preference for put options, which offer downside protection, over calls or bullish bets, according to data source Amberdata. In ETH's case, puts were pricier out to the July end expiry.
Traders typically buy put options to hedge their long positions in the spot and futures markets, protecting themselves from potential price declines.
""Risk reversals in both BTC and ETH continue to show a preference for downside protection across June and September tenors. This suggests that long holders are actively hedging spot exposure and preparing for potential drawdowns,"" Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a market note.
The nervousness is evident from the over-the-counter liquidity platform Paradigm, where the top five BTC trades for the week include a put spread and a bearish risk reversal. Meanwhile, in ETH's case, a long position in the $2,450 put crossed the tape alongside a short strangle (volatility) trade.
Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has spent over 40 days trading back and forth above $100,000, according to CoinDesk data. According to analysts, profit-taking by long-term holders and miner selling have counteracted the strong uptake for spot ETFs, leaving prices directionless.
""Bitcoin has recently tracked sideways, suggesting its current price may be too high for many retail investors. Open interest in BTC options has risen, with a positive and rising 25 delta put-call skew on 30-day contracts, which may imply that market participants are seeking short-term protection through put options,"" Coinbase Institutional's weekly report noted.
On Friday, BTC closed (UTC) below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) to trade below the key support for the first time since mid-April. The breakdown may lead to more chart-driven selling, potentially resulting in a drop below $100,000.
Some observers, however, expect a rally to new record highs. According to market observer Cas Abbé, BTC's on-balance volume continues to indicate strong buying pressure, suggesting that prices could rise to $130,000-$135,000 by the end of the third quarter.

As geopolitical tensions intensify and investor sentiment deteriorates, bearish pressure has continued spreading across Bitcoin’s spot and derivatives markets. 
The uncertainty surrounding global macroeconomic stability has led many market participants to take a risk-off approach, with the coin showing signs of vulnerability as the second quarter draws to a close.
With the coin struggling to rally momentum around the $103,000 price mark, Bitcoin futures traders have increasingly positioned against the coin. 
According to Coinglass, the coin’s long/short ratio — a key measure of trader sentiment — has tilted heavily toward shorts since June 17, indicating a growing belief that BTC’s recent rally may be losing momentum. At press time, the ratio is 0.95, indicating more traders are betting against the altcoin. 
This ratio compares the number of long and short positions in a market. When an asset’s long/short ratio is above 1, there are more long than short positions, indicating that traders are predominantly betting on a price increase.
Conversely, as seen with BTC, a ratio below one indicates that most traders are positioning for a price drop. This reflects heightened bearish sentiment and growing expectations of continued downside movements in the short term.
Moreover, daily chart readings from BTC’s BBTrend indicator reinforce the bearish outlook. As BTC’s price momentum weakens, the green histogram bars on the indicator have steadily fallen in size, signaling a decline in buying pressure and a loss of bullish strength.
The BBTrend is used to gauge the strength and direction of price trends. It appears as histogram bars — green when the trend is bullish and red when bearish. 
When the BBTrend turns negative or the green bars shrink, upward momentum is fading, and the asset may be entering a consolidation phase or facing a reversal. 
A consistently negative BBTrend suggests that selling pressure is dominating, increasing the likelihood of an extended price correction for BTC.
Yesterday, BTC’s price fell to a 15-day low of $102,345. Although it rebounded and closed at $103,297, bearish pressure remains, with the coin still down 2% over the past 24 hours.
If new demand continues to be limited, BTC’s price could extend its dip toward $101,520. Should the bulls fail to defend this critical support level, the asset could plunge further to $97,658.
On the other hand, if buying pressure strengthens, BTC could rebound and attempt a break above $103,952. A successful move past this level may open the door for a rally toward $106,295.

Now, crypto analyst Colin has indicated that the flagship crypto could still drop to as low as $92,800 and revealed what will happen if BTC gets there. 
The Current Bitcoin Price Action And What To Expect
In an X post, Colin said that it looks increasingly likely that the Bitcoin price will see a retest of at least 100,800 as the first major level of support. The analyst made this statement as BTC dropped out of a bullish pennant for a second time. The measured target for this bull pennant is $150,000. 
However, with the most recent breakdown, the Bitcoin price threatens to decline further before any potential move to the upside. Colin stated that the next major levels below $100,800 are $97,600 and $92,800. He opined that BTC is likely to quickly rebound from these support levels if it gets there. 
The crypto analyst remarked that this Bitcoin price movement is all possible within the confines of the right shoulder of the larger inverse Head-and-Shoulders pattern. He added that this can make the right shoulder more complete, basically on the same level as the left shoulder. This analysis comes just a day after Colin revealed that BTC has deviated from the global M2 money supply. 
However, he suggested that the BTC bull market is far from over. The analyst noted that the deviation happens 20% of the time and doesn’t invalidate the macro trend. Basically, the Bitcoin price is primed to rally higher at some point and possibly reach the $150,000 measured target. Market expert Raoul Pal also commented on BTC’s correlation with the money supply, stating that it shows that there is no need to worry about the current price action. 
Bulls Need To Step In For BTC
In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto stated that the Bulls need to step in now for the Bitcoin price. He noted that BTC is facing a key test, having just been rejected at the Fair Value Gap at around $106,000. The analyst added that the flagship crypto is now retesting the lower boundary of the symmetrical triangle. 
Titan of Crypto stated that if this lower boundary at around $104,000 fails, then the next level would be the previous weekly low at $102,679. If the Bitcoin price fails to hold that level, it could further drop to the liquidity pocket near $100,300. 
At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $103,500, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

When you think “crypto,” you think Bitcoin. Its surges and crashes have been treated as bellwethers for the entire industry. This year, it even set new records, solidifying its reign.
But for the past month, the crypto world hasn’t been talking about Bitcoin. The spotlight has been stolen by a company that most people have never heard of.
While Bitcoin’s price reached an all-time high this spring, its dominance is being challenged. Its market value, while still a colossal $2 trillion, is suddenly looking like yesterday’s news. Because in the world of finance, Wall Street and social media have a new darling: Circle Internet Group.
On June 5, Circle went public. Its IPO priced the stock at $31 a share, valuing the company at a respectable $6.3 billion. What happened next has been nothing short of explosive. In just eleven trading sessions, Circle’s stock skyrocketed 675%, pushing its market capitalization to over $48 billion.
To put that in perspective, Circle is now worth more than iconic industrial giants like Ford Motor Company and General Motors. The Big Three automakers in Detroit produce millions of physical cars per year. So, what does Circle produce to justify this staggering valuation?
The answer is surprisingly simple: a special type of cryptocurrency called a stablecoin.
Here’s how it works. You give Circle one U.S. dollar. In return, they give you one of their digital tokens, called USDC. This token is a stablecoin, meaning its value is pegged to a stable asset. In this case, the dollar you just gave them. It will always be worth $1 because, unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins aren’t designed to fluctuate in value. Circle then takes your actual dollar, invests it in safe, interest-bearing assets like short-term U.S. Treasury bonds, and pockets the yield. You get a digital dollar; they get the profit. That’s the entire business model.
What Wall Street is buying isn’t just a clever financial loop; it’s the hope that stablecoins are the future of money. The dream is that USDC will become as common as Visa or Mastercard for daily transactions, allowing people to move money cheaply and instantly without the volatility of other cryptocurrencies.
This hope is being fueled by a favorable wind from Washington. The Senate recently passed the “Genius Act,” a landmark piece of legislation that opens the door for banks, fintech companies like PayPal, and major retailers like Amazon to adopt stablecoins for payments. This is the first major, and notably friendly, crypto regulation approved by Congress. While it still needs to pass in the House, crypto advocates are optimistic.
Until now, stablecoins have mostly been used within the crypto world for trading or in decentralized finance (DeFi). But with this new legislation, Circle, which isn’t tied to a single financial institution, is perfectly positioned to become the big winner. Some are calling this the industry’s “iPhone moment.”
The Circle fever will likely rage on, at least until the company posts its first quarterly earnings. Only then will investors decide if the honeymoon continues.
In the meantime, if you want to sound like you know what’s happening on Wall Street and in the tech world, there’s a new name to drop.

The asset is hovering near $103,700 following a volatile 24-hour stretch, in which it briefly dropped below $103,400 before staging a modest recovery, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. This price behavior reflects an uneasy market backdrop, shaped by both geopolitical tensions and uncertain monetary policy.
According to an X post by crypto analytics firm Santiment on Thursday, sentiment among retail investors has turned sharply negative. The firm reported that the ratio of bullish to bearish commentary has fallen to just 1.03 to 1 — the lowest since early April, when the President Donald Trump unveiled his so-called Liberation Day tariffs, triggering peak market fear at the time. 
Santiment emphasized that this current wave of retail pessimism is unusually intense and, based on past patterns, may mark a contrarian signal for a price rebound. They specifically noted that back in April, Bitcoin rallied shortly after similar fear levels surfaced, suggesting large investors often use periods of retail capitulation to accumulate at favorable prices.
Adding to the pressure is the Federal Reserve's recent decision to hold interest rates steady, which has kept btcoin trading in a relatively tight $100,000 to $110,000 range over the past month. Meanwhile, on-chain metrics show declining open interest on Binance, pointing to continued deleveraging among derivatives traders. At the same time, whale wallets have shown steady accumulation since 2023 — an indication that large holders are continuing to build their positions despite the short-term uncertainty.

Bulls initially celebrated a short-lived rally into resistance, which sparked hope of a breakout—but the excitement was quickly overshadowed by a swift retrace. The move back into the $103,000–$104,000 demand zone has reintroduced fear and caution across the market, with investors growing uneasy in the face of mounting macroeconomic and geopolitical risks.
Middle East tensions and rising global uncertainty continue to weigh heavily on sentiment, keeping volatility elevated and market participants on edge. The current environment has become especially difficult to navigate, as conflicting signals and rapid reversals create an unstable trading landscape.
The current structure shows Bitcoin at the bottom of its recent range, with liquidity building below. This could provide fuel for a potential sweep and fast reversal back into the range, similar to the false breakout seen earlier from the top side. However, if this support zone fails to hold, a deeper correction becomes more likely, especially given the market’s heavy tone.
Bitcoin continues to show resilience above the $100,000 level, a psychological and technical milestone that has held since early June. Despite this strength, the market lacks the momentum needed to break through the $112,000 all-time high and push into price discovery. Instead, Bitcoin remains trapped within a multi-week range, as macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions weigh heavily on investor sentiment.
Rising US Treasury yields, persistent inflation concerns, and the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold interest rates steady have all contributed to tightening financial conditions. On top of that, growing instability in the Middle East adds another layer of volatility to an already cautious market. These factors have created a difficult environment for risk assets, especially those like Bitcoin that are seeking a clear directional move.
Price action over the past week has taken Bitcoin back to the lower end of its trading range. The $103,000–$104,000 zone is emerging as a critical support level. While the range has held for now, the inability to reclaim higher resistance levels near $109,000 raises the risk of further downside.
Crypto analyst Daan noted that BTC is currently sitting at the range low—a key level with substantial liquidity below. This area could act as a springboard if swept and reclaimed quickly, just as a similar move occurred near the range high earlier. However, he warned that if such a reversal fails to materialize, the market could be setting up for a deeper drop later in June.
Bitcoin’s ability to maintain this $100K+ structure is pivotal. Without a decisive break above the ATH, and in the absence of fresh bullish catalysts, the possibility of extended consolidation—or even downside—remains a valid scenario through the end of the month.
Bitcoin continues to face strong resistance, with the price failing to hold above the $106,000 level and now testing key support around $103,000. The 4-hour chart shows multiple rejections near the $109,300 zone, establishing it as a critical supply area. After briefly reclaiming the 50 and 100-period SMAs earlier this week, BTC has broken below all major moving averages once again, reflecting increasing short-term bearish pressure.
The recent breakdown from the $103,600 support area—a level that had acted as a strong pivot since early June—raises concern. This zone has now been lost and retested, suggesting potential continuation lower if bulls don’t step in soon. Volume also spiked on the latest drop, indicating that sellers are growing more aggressive.
Below current levels, $102,000 remains the next immediate zone of interest. A flush of liquidity under this level could offer a chance for a reversal if absorbed quickly, but if the price fails to reclaim $103,600 soon, bearish momentum may intensify. On the upside, bulls must first reclaim the 100-SMA around $105,870 to regain control of short-term trend structure.

Industry commentators are debating which asset, XRP or Bitcoin, offers a better investment opportunity at current price levels.
Leading the conversation is Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy. He suggests that XRP presents a more attractive risk-reward profile in the current market cycle. According to him, XRP’s price potential remains conservative and realistic compared to Bitcoin trading above $100,000.
“You’d have to be insane to think Bitcoin at $106K is a better investment than XRP,” he said.
Notably, XRP is trading around $2. Farina’s statement implies that the coin could outperform and deliver greater returns than Bitcoin, which is already in the six-figure price range.
Farina points to previous market conditions, such as when XRP was $0.50 while Bitcoin traded at $70,000 in 2024. From that range, XRP went on to reach $3.40, offering approximately a 7X return for holders.
To put it in perspective: 100,000 XRP tokens purchased at $0.50 in November 2024 for $50,000 would have grown to $340,000 by January 2025. With XRP’s current price at $2.10, the asset still holds over 4X gains for those investors.
Meanwhile, Bitcoin rose from about $68,000 during the same period to a new all-time high of approximately $112,000. This amounted to a 64% gain, whereas XRP delivered nearly ten times more. For comparison, $50,000 invested in Bitcoin in November 2024 reached a peak value of only around $82,352.
In contrast, the same $50,000 invested in XRP grew to $340,000. Given this significant performance gap, XRP proponents continue to advocate for the asset over Bitcoin.
One commenter responding to Farina’s post emphasized that the conversation isn’t about being anti-Bitcoin, but about recognizing asymmetric opportunities. 
With XRP at $2, they argued that even a move to $5 or $10 would represent significant upside in multiples higher than what Bitcoin could realistically achieve from its current position.
Another user highlighted the limitations of average retail investors, noting that most people don’t have $10,000 to invest in Bitcoin, let alone expect it to multiply several times over. 
They argued that allocating such capital to XRP makes more sense from a return-on-investment perspective. At current prices, $10,000 would buy only about 0.09 BTC, which would return $47,000 if Bitcoin hit $500,000, a scenario they called a “big if.” 
By contrast, XRP offers significantly higher ROI potential for the same investment, in their view. Farina agrees with this perspective. 
In a previous commentary, he boldly asserted that if Bitcoin rose to $500,000, XRP could soar to $100. In that case, Bitcoin would deliver a 5X gain for holders, while XRP would yield over 40X.
However, critics are challenging the pro-XRP narrative against Bitcoin. One commenter questioned the comparison by highlighting XRP’s historical performance.
Specifically, they noted that while Bitcoin has risen from $20,000 to over $112,000 since its 2017–2018 highs, XRP has still not returned to its previous all-time high from the same period. 
This challenges the assumption that XRP’s lower price relative to Bitcoin means it will necessarily perform better in the future, particularly given XRP’s long-standing historical underperformance.

And the next big milestone on everyone’s radar is $120K.
With fresh rate-cut rumors swirling around the Federal Reserve, the setup for a continued rally is starting to look eerily perfect.
But while Bitcoin steals the spotlight, the real hidden gem might be quietly building in the background.
Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a lightning-fast, Solana-compatible Layer-2 designed to scale $BTC – and it might just be the infrastructure play of this bull run.
There’s a storm of macro news brewing – and surprisingly, it’s bullish for crypto.
The Federal Reserve, after months of playing hardball on inflation, may finally be loosening its grip. Recent comments from Fed officials and fresh rate-cut speculation for July have markets buzzing.
The reason? A double-whammy of war tensions and trade tariffs could drag down global growth, forcing the Fed to pivot.
Historically, rate cuts weaken the dollar and light a fire under risk assets. And Bitcoin, being the king of risk-on trades, thrives on this kind of chaos.
But what happens when Bitcoin actually starts running again?
Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the Layer-2 solution that finally gives Bitcoin its long-overdue upgrade.
Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it’s not a sidechain or half-measure – it’s a fully operational blockchain engineered to scale Bitcoin in a way that actually works.
For the first time, developers, degens, and builders can create lightning-fast, low-cost dApps directly on the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Think of it like this: Bitcoin is the vault. Bitcoin Hyper is the high-speed highway connected to it – one that unlocks sub-second transaction speeds and near-zero gas fees.
It’s the first real execution layer for Bitcoin, turning it from a passive store of value into an active financial playground. Now, Bitcoin can support payments, meme coins, NFTs, DAOs, and DeFi – all under one roof.
With the Fed hinting at a rate cut, the timing couldn’t be better. If Bitcoin surges, the infrastructure around it, especially one this fast and meme-ready, could take off even faster.
At just $0.011975, Bitcoin Hyper is still in presale, but it’s not going unnoticed. This new crypto project has already raised over $1.4M, and that early-stage window is closing fast.

Analysts predict $HYPER could hit as high as $0.32 by the end of 2025. That’s a potential 2,570% increase from today’s presale price. Let’s do the math.
Say you buy $1K worth of $HYPER at the current price. You’d get roughly 83,5K tokens. Bitcoin Hyper plans to offer staking with competitive APYs. Let’s go with a modest estimate of 20% APY.
Stake those tokens for a year, and you’d earn an extra 16,7K tokens, bringing your total to 100,2K $HYPER.
And that’s not counting early access to token launches, staking pools, governance, and other utility perks presale buyers get.
This is how early plays turn into power positions. With $BTC momentum climbing, $HYPER could be one of the best altcoins to ride this wave.
With the Fed pivot in sight and Bitcoin heating up, the next bull run isn’t a matter of if – it’s when. But when the market takes off, it’s not just $BTC that flies. It’s the infrastructure around it.
That’s where Bitcoin Hyper shines. It’s not trying to replace Bitcoin, it’s here to power the ecosystem with real speed, real apps, and real scalability. While others chase hype, $HYPER is laying the foundation.
And when the market stampede begins, the ones who build the rails get there first.

				As a crypto writer, Bogdan’s responsibilities are split between researching and writing articles and entertaining the team with his humor bordering on the politically incorrect, an aspiring Bill Burr, if you will.

Thanks to his 12+ years of writing experience in just as many fields, including tech, cybersecurity, modelling, fitness, crypto, and other topics-that-shall-not-be-named, he's become a genuine asset to the team.

While his position as a senior writer at PrivacyAffairs thought him valuable lessons about the power of self-management, his entire writing career was and is an exercise in self-improvement.

Now, he's ready to sink his teeth into crypto and teach people how to take control of their own money on the blockchain. With fiat as an eternally devaluing currency, Bitcoin and altcoins seem like the best-fitting alternative for Bogdan.

Bogdan’s biggest professional accomplishment, aside from securing a position as a main writer for Bitcoinist, was his 5-year run as a writing manager at Blackwood Productions, where he coordinated a team of four writers.

During that time, he learned the value of teamwork and that of creating a working environment that breeds efficiency, positivity, and friendship.

It still has plenty of capacity for big growth during the next 10 years, too. The coin's scarcity, diehard holder base, and newfound status as a darling of institutional investors still make it an appealing purchase today.
History won't repeat perfectly, but it can rhyme. Could $10,000 invested into Bitcoin right now turn into $1 million by 2035, or will the upside be more limited this time around? Let's test the numbers and see what's possible for a long-term investment.
Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »
First, let's establish the parameters of what needs to happen.
A $10,000 investment can become $1 million only if Bitcoin climbs 100-fold from today's price. That hurdle looks insurmountable -- until you consider the coin's incredible compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 84% during the last 10 years.
Supply dynamics lend credence to the idea that Bitcoin is going to continue producing new millionaires.
The next halving of the coin's issuance, projected for April 2028, will drop the block reward to just over 1.5 bitcoins, thereby cutting new issuance in half yet again and further constraining Bitcoin's newly mined supply. By 2032, the reward is set to shrink to roughly 0.7. Fewer fresh coins with each block will continue to force later buyers to haggle with existing holders. That's historically a recipe for higher prices, even if there isn't a large influx of new demand.
Image source: Getty Images.
On that front, demand for the coin is now something driven largely by institutional investors and governments, two of the very largest holders of capital. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) January 2024 green light for Bitcoin-holding exchange-traded funds (ETFs) removed the last barrier to institutional adoption. The implication is that the world's capital can now get as much Bitcoin exposure as it wants, and so far, it looks like they have a large appetite for it.
Corporate treasuries are now piling in as well. There are currently at least 61 non-crypto public companies that hold Bitcoin. These balance sheet stakes aren't intended for quick flips, but rather for holding as an asset. So they'll constrain the coin's floating supply even further, creating a very favorable environment for the price to zoom upwards.
When combining these factors, it's still probably a bit optimistic to expect the coin to continue to exhibit its historical CAGR. But that doesn't mean it won't still grow at a very quick pace. For what it's worth, the coin's CAGR during the past four years is 27%.
Overall, it's much more reasonable to expect Bitcoin to gain 10-fold between now and 2035, leaving someone who invested $10,000 with about $100,000, than it is to expect such an investment to yield a full $1 million.
Assuming the coin's four-year CAGR is sustained during the next 10 years, investing $10,000 today would net you around $109,000.
It could still surprise investors to the upside, of course. Still, that's not something to build your financial planning around, and there are a few risks worth knowing about.
Bitcoin has never faced a mature regulatory regime. The same government that blessed ETFs today could crack down on self-custody or levy punitive taxes if political winds shift, and they very well might. Furthermore, corporate balance sheet accumulation of the asset is two-edged. If Bitcoin slides under $90,000, nearly half the new treasury adopters will sit on unrealized losses, raising headline risk and introducing the specter of forced liquidations.
Technological risk is another (and underrated) risk. Quantum computers capable of breaking Bitcoin's encryption could arrive sooner than many expect. Some warn that Bitcoin needs a post-quantum security upgrade within five years.
For investors, the antidote for these risks is patience.
Allocate only what fits your risk budget, dollar-cost average (DCA) into your position to tame volatility, and simply don't look at your portfolio during times of turbulence. If you size your positions assuming a middle-of-the-road growth trajectory, the trek to a position worth $1 million becomes an eventuality, rather than something to worry about rushing toward.

Sellers are stepping in at key supply zones, pushing back against attempts to enter price discovery above the $112K all-time high. Despite this pressure, Bitcoin remains resilient above the psychologically significant $100K mark, where it has found support since early June.
The latest on-chain data from Gemini and Glassnode reveals a noteworthy structural shift: over 30% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply is now held by just 216 centralized entities. These include exchanges, ETFs, funds, public and private companies, DeFi contracts, and even governments. Exchanges currently hold the largest share, while public companies represent the most numerous holders. This trend highlights the deepening custodial centralization of Bitcoin, raising both adoption optimism and decentralization concerns.
As the macroeconomic backdrop remains volatile—with high US Treasury yields, the Fed holding interest rates, and geopolitical tensions intensifying—Bitcoin’s price action is becoming increasingly sensitive to shifts in sentiment and liquidity. Whether BTC can hold this key support or slide deeper into correction will depend on upcoming volume reactions and potential moves from these dominant custodial players.
Bitcoin is currently down 8% from its $112K all-time high, hovering in a broad consolidation phase with no decisive breakout. The price action suggests that the market is at a critical juncture, with traders split between two possibilities: a deeper retracement toward the $94K level or a renewed push into price discovery. This indecision is amplified by ongoing geopolitical tensions, particularly the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Many analysts warn that if the United States steps in, it could trigger panic across global markets, creating spillover effects into the crypto space.
Meanwhile, key insights from Glassnode and Gemini shed light on a growing trend in Bitcoin’s ownership structure. Over 30% of the circulating supply is now held by just 216 centralized entities. This reflects a dual narrative—on one hand, increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve or investment asset, and on the other, rising custodial centralization that may undermine the network’s decentralized ethos.
The largest holdings belong to crypto exchanges, ETFs, and funds, followed by public and private companies that have allocated BTC to their balance sheets. A notable portion is also locked in DeFi contracts, with some controlled by governments following seizures or strategic acquisitions.
While this growing centralization may boost credibility and capital inflow, it also introduces new risks to liquidity and distribution. In such a fragile macro environment, Bitcoin’s next major move will depend not only on technical setups but also on the behavior of these key holders under pressure.
Bitcoin has retraced from its recent local high of $106,500 and is now trading around the $103,100 mark, testing a key support level highlighted in yellow on the chart—specifically the $103,600 zone. This level served as resistance earlier in the year and is now acting as a critical demand area during this consolidation phase. A daily or 3-day close below this threshold could signal further downside and open the door for a retest of the $100,000 psychological support.
The chart shows lower highs forming since the $112,000 all-time high, which, if continued, may form a descending triangle structure—typically a bearish continuation pattern. Price rejection around $109,300 confirms that sellers remain in control at higher levels. Volume is slightly elevated on red candles, suggesting increased distribution.
The 50 and 100 moving averages (at approximately $94,700 and $87,500, respectively) remain well below the current price, indicating room for further retracement if bearish momentum builds. Still, the broader uptrend remains intact unless price decisively breaks below the $100,000 level.
Bulls need to reclaim $106,500 and close above $109,300 to signal strength. Until then, Bitcoin appears locked in a tightening range, with downside risk increasing in the short term.

The cryptocurrency market is abuzz with contrasting opinions following a volatile trading session on Friday, which pulled down Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and eventually the whole crypto market, following a colossal sell-off. With the market sentiment and most technical analysis being refreshed, crypto traders and analysts are split on divided speculations about whether the digital asset has reached its peak or is poised for further gains. 
Yet, the market took a hit on Friday, with Bitcoin dropping approximately 5% amid profit-taking and macroeconomic uncertainty. Sentiment analysis from Santiment, conducted on June 20, 2025, revealed a near-even split in social media attitudes—1.03 bullish comments for every bearish one—indicating a market at a crossroads. This ambivalence contrasts with the bullish narrative, suggesting potential for either a sustained rally or a correction. 
A notable post by crypto trader CryptoFella on X shares that despite Friday’s shakeout, Bitcoin’s upward trajectory remains intact. In a “zoomed out” frame, CryptoFella’s chart shows close to no dip in Bitcoin price.
$BTC – #Bitcoin: Watch me do it. The top for $BTC is not in yet, simple as that. pic.twitter.com/N4dMF4z3eo
The chart, highlighting a breakout above previous resistance levels, aligns with a drastic surge in 24-hour trading volume on major crypto exchanges. Crypto Fella boldly asserted, “The top for $BTC is not in yet, simple as that,” pointing to historical patterns like the late 2020 rally, when Bitcoin soared from $19,000 to over $60,000 in months. 
Agreeing with this view, several Bitcoin enthusiasts are holding onto hope despite the cryptocurrency trading below its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and outside an upward trending channel, as noted by analyst Josh Mandell. 
Yes, I see that BTC is trading below the 50 Day SMA and outside my upward trending channel but I still believe we close the month green.   She may feel like she's breaking up Captain, but I think she'll hold. pic.twitter.com/d0uXipyNXn
Mandell remains bullish, predicting a green close for the month, even as the market shows signs of strain. The sentiment echoes amid geopolitical uncertainties, with mentions of potential Iran-US negotiations possibly influencing market dynamics, as suggested in related online discussions. 
Meanwhile, Fundstrat’s Mark Newton, a veteran with over 25 years in finance, has identified a critical support level at $102,800, offering a cautious counterpoint to the optimism as traders watch for a potential rebound.
Technical indicators present a mixed picture as Bitcoin’s medium- to long-term outlook seems “slightly negative,” largely due to a break below a rising trend channel and negative volume balance, where sellers appear more aggressive. Conversely, short-term signals remain positive, with the currency showing resilience. 
The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, updated recently, hovers in the “Neutral” zone, reflecting investor caution after the Friday dump.
Industry experts caution that Bitcoin’s volatility, historically driven by sentiment and trading volume, could likely amplify a downtrend. However, a strong long-term cointegration between Bitcoin’s price and trade volume might sustain buying pressure and propel further gains—given that the current uncertainty resolves in favor of optimism. 
As the weekend unfolds, traders are closely monitoring key support levels around $100K–$102K for the Bitcoin price, with many eyeing the next breakout as a litmus test for recent predictions. For now, the market remains a battleground of hope and hesitation, with Bitcoin’s next move hanging in the balance.

The rise of Bitcoin ETFs continues at a frantic pace. Through its IBIT fund, BlackRock has just taken over more than 3.25% of the circulating supply of BTC. This strengthens its grip on the market. More details in the paragraphs below!
YES! In less than 18 months, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF has become a key player in the market. With $69.7 billion in assets under management, it now holds more than half of the US Bitcoin ETF market share. This represents exactly 54.7%.
According to data, this figure alone represents 3.25% of all bitcoin in circulation. This illustrates a strategic accumulation by institutional investors.
BlackRock’s fund thus ranks 23rd globally among ETFs, across all sectors. This performance is supported by massive institutional flows. We refer to the $388 million of BTC that flowed into American ETFs in a single day. This marks eight consecutive sessions of positive inflows. Proof of growing interest in index funds backed by digital assets!
While Bitcoin ETFs record record volumes, the market structure is evolving. According to Glassnode, 89% of transactions on the Bitcoin network exceed $100,000. This proves that major investors now dictate the rules of the game. The average volume per transaction reaches $36,200, and small holders are becoming rare.
Another fact revealed by CryptoQuant: the cohort of short-term holders has gone from 5.3 to 4.5 million BTC in less than a month. This drop of 800,000 BTC highlights a slowdown in retail activity.
If this trend continues, the next major support could be around $92,000. This corresponds to the realized price level of traders.
The market thus seems to be entering an era where ETFs and institutions take over from individuals. If a new catalyst emerges, the rise in demand could push bitcoin into a new sustainable bull market.

At press time, bitcoin had pared some of the losses, returning to $103,200, down 1.2% over the past 24 hours.
Other large cryptocurrencies endured steeper declines. Ethereum's ether ETH$2,408.79 saw a sharp 4.5% drop in just 90 minutes to as low as $2,372, with trading volume spiking to nearly 800,000 ETH, nearly eight times the average hourly volume, per CoinDesk data. Solana's SOL SOL$139.39, dogecoin DOGE$0.15982 and Cardano's ADA ADA$0.57386 were 3%-5% lower over the same period.
The volatility burst caught many traders off-guard, liquidating about $450 million in derivatives trading positions on centralized exchanges across all digital assets, CoinGlass data shows. Some $387 million of liquidations were tied to long positions that bet on profiting from rising prices.
While macro risks abound — among them the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran — there was no immediate external reason for the sudden price swing. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 indexes only inched lower during the day.
Zooming out, BTC continues to trade within a sideways range between $100,000 and $110,000, consolidating just below its all-time record level.
""The mixed view of whether BTC will go above $110,000 again or drop into the $90,000 area doesn’t surprise me at all and underscores the overall indecision people and markets feel,"" said James Toledano, chief operating officer at Unity Wallet.
""The present BTC stalemate reflects a market caught between bullish long-term sentiment and short-term macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty,"" he added.

For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.
As Asia begins its trading day, bitcoin BTC$103,135.92 is trading above $104,500 and, despite a possible looming war in the Middle East, has been relatively flat on the day with negligible market movement. Indeed, for the last full week, BTC is only down 2%, according to CoinDesk market data.
Analysts are debating whether the crypto market’s current stillness is a sign of strength or if something more precarious is afoot.
Three new reports this week from CryptoQuant, Glassnode, and trading firm Flowdesk all point to the same surface conditions: low volatility, tight price action, and subdued on-chain activity. Additionally, retail participation has waned, and institutional players, from ETFs to whales, are now shaping the structure of flows.
But it’s CryptoQuant that’s flashing the most urgent warning.
In its June 19 report, CryptoQuant argued that BTC could soon revisit $92,000 support or even fall as low as $81,000 if demand continues to deteriorate.
Spot demand is still increasing, but well below trend. ETF flows have dropped by more than 60% since April, while whale accumulation has halved. Short-term holders, who are usually newer market participants, have shed approximately 800,000 BTC since late May.
Their demand momentum indicator, which tracks directional buying strength across key cohorts, is now reading negative 2 million BTC, the lowest in CryptoQuant’s dataset.
Glassnode, however, sees the same signals and arrives at a far less dire conclusion.
In its weekly on-chain update, the firm acknowledges that the Bitcoin blockchain is “quiet,"" meaning transaction counts are down, fees are minimal, and miner revenue is subdued.
However, this suggests that it may not be a weakness, but rather a reflection of the network’s evolution. On-chain settlement volume remains high, but it’s concentrated in large-value transfers, suggesting the chain is increasingly being used by institutions and whales.
The derivatives market, Glassnode notes, now dwarfs on-chain activity, with futures and options volumes regularly exceeding spot by 7x–16x.
That shift has brought more sophisticated hedging, better collateral practices, and a more mature, if less frenetic, market structure.
France-based Flowdesk, a market maker and trading firm, has views that fall somewhere in between.
While noting thinning altcoin flows and flat market-making volumes, its June 19 update describes the market as “coiled,” not cracking.
Flowdesk highlights a surge in tokenized assets, such as Gold-backed XAUT (up 56% in volume), stablecoin growth, and increasing RWA activity.
To them, low volatility may simply be the calm before a directional breakout, which is not necessarily downwards.
But in the end, no one seems to hold a reliable map for what’s ahead.
Even Polymarket bettors aren't sure as there is  a near equal chance of BTC dropping to $90K in June or moving up to $115K-120K.
One thing is for sure: the tug-of-war between bullish institutional activities and waning retail demand potentially opens bitcoin up to dramatic moves on either side of the trade, which will likely dictate the market’s next chapter.
A new report from Presto Research argues that Crypto Treasury Companies (CTCs), such as Strategy and Metaplanet, are not just leveraged bitcoin ETFs, but a new form of financial engineering with less risk than many investors assume.
Strategy’s latest raise, which raised nearly $1 billion via perpetual preferred shares, shows how BTC’s volatility can be used to an issuer’s advantage.
These securities, along with convertible bonds and at-the-market equity sales, allow CTCs to fund aggressive crypto accumulation without triggering margin risk.
Presto points out that Strategy’s BTC is unpledged and Metaplanet’s bonds are unsecured, meaning collateral liquidation, the primary trigger in past crypto blowups like Celsius and Three Arrows, is largely absent here. That does not eliminate risk, but it changes the nature of it.
The real challenge, Presto argues, is not crypto exposure itself but the discipline to manage dilution, cash flow, and capital timing.
Metaplanet’s “bitcoin yield” metric, which measures BTC per fully diluted share, reflects that focus on shareholder value.
As long as CTCs can manage the financial mechanics behind their accumulation strategies, they will earn NAV premiums just like high-growth companies in traditional markets. But if they miscalculate, the same tools that fuel their rise could accelerate their fall.
Semler Scientific (Nasdaq: SMLR) has unveiled one of the most aggressive bitcoin accumulation roadmaps in corporate history, announcing plans to hold 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, 42,000 by 2026, and a staggering 105,000 by the close of 2027.
The California-based medical device maker, which pivoted to a bitcoin treasury strategy last year, is effectively trying to increase its current bitcoin stash of 4,449 coins by more than two fold over the next 30 months.
It plans to do so using a mix of equity raises, debt financing, and operational cash flow.
There aren't specific details of how the company plans to fund the buy. Hwever, historically Semler’s primary mechanism for acquiring bitcoin was selling new shares under its at-the-market (ATM) program, which relies on the company trading at a premium to its net asset value (NAV).
According to data from Strategy-Tracker, Semler’s mNAV currently sits at 0.859x, meaning the market values the firm’s equity lower than its BTC holdings, which could be cutting off its ability to raise accretive capital.
How this dynamic plays out, would be worth watching as the firm initiates more bitcoin buying. Even as bitcoin has surged to all-time highs above $100,000, Semler shares are down nearly 40% on the year.

The move puts BCH within striking distance of the psychologically critical $500 level — a zone last touched during April's breakout attempt.
If momentum persists, BCH could attempt to flip $500 into a long-term support — a move that could change its macro structure heading into Q3.
BCH rallied from $461.87 to a high of $492.08 over 24 hours, backed by strong inflows. The breakout began in earnest during the 13:00–14:00 window, when volume spiked to 152,140 units — more than five times the hourly average — confirming institutional buying.
The price rejected off the $500 barrier multiple times, slipping to $490.46 during the early morning session before stabilizing. A brief sell-off at 04:51 triggered a quick dip to $491.47, but price soon reclaimed $485, showing signs of resilience and consolidation just below key resistance.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is hovering above the key support level on Friday; a breach below this level could trigger a sharp decline. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) followed BTC’s footsteps and stabilized around their crucial levels, with a failure below their support levels indicating a potential correction ahead.
Traders remain cautious as President Donald Trump is expected to decide within two weeks whether the US will intervene in the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict, a move that could decide the risk sentiment toward crypto markets.
Bitcoin price drew liquidity from its Fair Value Gap (FVG) around $108,064 on Monday and declined by 2.1% the following day. BTC has retested and found support multiple times around the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at approximately $103,100, highlighting its strength as dynamic support. At the time of writing on Friday, it trades at around $104,500.
If BTC continues its correction and closes below the 50-day EMA at $103,100 on a daily basis, it could extend the decline to retest its key psychologically important level at $100,000.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum indicator on the daily chart reads 47, below its neutral level of 50, indicating that bearish momentum is gaining traction. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator displayed a bearish crossover last week. It also shows rising red histogram bars below its neutral level, indicating bearish momentum and giving credence to the downward trend.
BTC/USDT daily chart
However, if BTC closes above its FVG level at $108,064, it could extend the recovery toward retesting its May 22 all-time high of $111,980.
Ethereum price retested and found support around its 50-day EMA at $2,441 on Wednesday, consolidating at this level the following day. This level coincides with the lower consolidation boundary of $2,461, making it a key support zone. At the time of writing on Friday, it hovers at around $2,514.
If ETH closes below the 50-day EMA at $2,441, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $2,000.
The RSI on the daily chart momentum indicator reads 48, below its neutral level of 50, indicating that bearish momentum is gaining traction. The MACD indicator displayed a bearish crossover last week. It also shows rising red histogram bars below its neutral level, indicating bearish momentum and giving credence to the downward trend.
ETH/USDT daily chart
On the contrary, if ETH finds support around its 50-day EMA at $2,441 and recovers, it could extend the recovery to retest its upper consolidation boundary at $2,724.
XRP price attempted to close above the 50-day EMA at $2.24 on Monday but failed, subsequently declining by 3.53% the following day and consolidating around the $2.15 level until Thursday. At the time of writing on Friday, it hovers around $2.16.
If XRP faces a correction, it could extend the decline to retest its next daily support level at $1.96.
The RSI on the daily chart reads 44, below its neutral level and points downward, indicating strong bearish momentum. Moreover, the MACD indicator on the daily chart displayed a bearish crossover, signaling a sell and indicating a downward trend.
XRP/USDT daily chart
However, if XRP recovers and closes above the 50-day EMA at $2.24, it could extend the recovery toward the May 23 high of $2.47.
Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.
Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 
Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

The adoption of cryptocurrency-related financial products, including tokenized treasuries, is on overdrive globally, with the focus now shifting to robust networks such as Ripple's XRP Ledger (XRPL).
Sei extends gains above $0.21, decoupling the token from the broader crypto market amid low sentiment and macroeconomic uncertainty. The Wyoming Stable Token Commission selects Sei Network as a candidate blockchain for the WYST, the first fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a US state.
Bitcoin bulls step up, pushing the price above $106,000, as Trump said he would delay his decision about launching strikes on Iran for up to two weeks. Ethereum rebounds from the 200-day EMA support at $2,477 amid steady interest in the derivatives market.
Solana experiences a minor uptick of under 1% at press time on Friday, with multiple long shadow candles forming above $140 as bearish momentum fades off. The optimism surrounding Solana is on the rise, as evidenced by the SOL Open Interest reaching a weekly high.
Bitcoin (BTC) price remains steady above a key support level, trading slightly above $106,000 at the time of writing on Friday. The uncertainty looms as geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel show no sign yet of an exit strategy from either side.

Bitcoin BTC$103,110.88 hovered near $104,700 during Asia hours, slipping 1.2% over 24 hours, while ether ETH$2,400.52 traded just below $2,860, down 1.8% on the day.
The soft price action tracks with broader macro unease following Wednesday’s FOMC hold, where the Fed kept rates unchanged but reiterated a cautious, inflation-sensitive stance.
Historically subdued during the June-July stretch, crypto markets have entered a lull with BTC front-end implied volumes slipping under 40%, erasing the risk premium from recent geopolitical tension, Singapore-based QCP Capital noted in a Thursday market broadcast.
Open interest across BTC and ETH perps remains flat, and option markets skew negative, with puts trading at a premium to calls – a sign of traders hedging against short-term pullbacks.
“There’s been no change to the technical picture, which remains supportive of another push to the topside,” said Joel Kruger, strategist at LMAX Group, in an email to CoinDesk. “BTC continues to consolidate bullishly, and a move through recent highs could set up a run toward $145,000.”
Ether still lags its 2021 highs but is gaining momentum, he added. “Clearing $2,900 could bring $3,400 into play,” Kruger said.
One bright spot for crypto is the U.S. Senate’s passage of a stablecoin framework, which adds another building block to what is becoming a more regulatory-friendly global environment. That’s reinforced a broader institutional conviction.
“Globally, we’re seeing continued progress that promises greater clarity and a more welcoming environment for institutional crypto adoption,” Kruger added.
Still, the near-term setup remains cautious. Month-end OPEX flows, systematic rebalancing, and a lack of fresh catalysts could keep BTC stuck in its $ 102,000–$ 108,000 band for now.
But with H2 historically strong for crypto, some desks are already looking ahead. “The worst may be behind us,” Kruger said. “And the next leg up could catch many off guard.”

Here's something you don't see every day: Bitcoin's lesser-known cousins are stealing the show while the king of crypto takes a nap.
Bitcoin Cash has gone absolutely ballistic, rocketing 98% since its low point in April and trying to break the $500 resistance mark for good. Meanwhile, Bitcoin SV—yes, that controversial fork led by Satoshi pretender Craig Wright—is quietly climbing.
This rotation reflects broader market dynamics, with the S&P 500 on Friday hitting 6,000 points for the first time since February, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq approaches its own record near 20,000 as short-term traders appear to have priced in the panic over the current geopolitical events.
The Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates steady at 4.25%-4.5% on Wednesday has created a wait-and-see environment, with policymakers noting that ""uncertainty about the economic outlook has diminished, but remains elevated.""
Meanwhile, oil prices climbed over 4% on Tuesday as the Iran-Israel conflict raged, with Brent crude settling at $76.45—a development that traditionally correlates with crypto volatility, but has yet to significantly impact digital asset prices in the days since.
Bitcoin is putting investors to sleep with a 2% to $103,154 over the last week. The flagship cryptocurrency has entered a critical consolidation phase after failing to reclaim the $108,000-$109,000 resistance zone.
For traders watching the tape, this sideways grind often comes before the fireworks—for good or bad.
The weekly chart reveals a market in equilibrium, with several key indicators painting a nuanced picture:
RSI (Relative Strength Index): At 62 on the weekly time frame, Bitcoin shows mild bullish momentum without approaching overbought territory. The RSI measures the speed and magnitude of price changes: readings above 70 typically indicate overbought conditions where traders might expect a pullback, while below 30 suggests oversold levels that could precede a bounce. Bitcoin's current reading indicates healthy bullish momentum that could support further upside.
ADX (Average Directional Index): Reading 26, the ADX has just crossed the crucial 25 threshold, suggesting a trend is beginning to form in longer time frames. This indicator measures trend strength regardless of direction: below 20 indicates no trend, 20-25 shows a developing trend, and above 25 confirms trend establishment. For momentum traders, this crossing above 25 could signal the start of a more decisive move.
Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs): Bitcoin currently trades above its 50-week EMA (the average price of the last 50 weeks—basically one year), but faces resistance from the convergence of multiple time frames. The 50-200 EMA spread remains positive, which technical analysts often interpret as a bullish market structure. When shorter-term averages stay above longer-term ones, it typically indicates sustained buying pressure.
Squeeze Momentum Indicator: The ""off"" status on the weekly chart suggests volatility has already been released, contradicting the daily chart's compression. This divergence between time frames often precedes significant moves as different trader cohorts position themselves.
Key Levels:
Bitcoin Cash is the week's star performer with a commanding 14.57% surge to $483, briefly breaking past the psychologically significant $500 level—but it’s been unable to maintain momentum. BCH social media mentions surged as the price began to recover, pushing it to a new peak for 2025.
The weekly chart presents a compelling bullish case with room for continuation, with some cautions needed, of course:
RSI at 63: This reading places BCH in what traders often call the ""power zone"" —strong enough to indicate genuine momentum, but not yet extended enough to trigger profit-taking. Historical analysis shows BCH tends to run until RSI reaches 75-80, suggesting approximately 20% additional upside potential before overbought conditions emerge. That would match the resistance of the current triangle that has been in place since April.
ADX at 18: While below the 25 trend confirmation level, this reading shows that markets are fighting to push prices forward. However, this might not be a bad signal, and interpretation will vary as the indicator is analyzed alongside other readings. Low ADX readings after a strong move often indicate consolidation before the next leg higher. Traders might interpret this as the market digesting gains before attempting the next resistance level.
Moving Average Configuration: BCH trades decisively above both its 50-week and 200-week EMAs, with increasing separation between them. This expanding gap, known as moving average divergence, typically indicates strong trending conditions. The 50-week EMA near $385 now serves as dynamic support, while the 200-week mark at $352 provides a floor for any deeper corrections.
Key Levels:

BSV's 6% weekly gain to $31.47 since last Friday's low might look like small potatoes next to BCH's moonshot, but context is everything. The controversial fork is now trading 30% above its June lows despite persistent skepticism, finishing the week as the seventh-best performing cryptocurrency among the top 100. However, today's correction is giving signs of a flat performance if the week's shadows are not considered.
BSV's chart is like reading tea leaves, but here's what technical traders are seeing.
The RSI at 43 is slightly bearish but not terrible. Think of it as a car running on fumes, but not quite empty. Some contrarian traders love buying when RSI is this low, as they're betting on a bounce. History shows BSV often bottoms between 35-40, so we're in the danger zone where brave souls start nibbling.
Also, the ADX at 19 is yet another weak trend reading that creates a coiled spring scenario. When ADX readings remain below 20 for extended periods, the eventual breakout (in either direction) tends to be violent. Range traders might play the boundaries, while trend followers await confirmation above 25.
As for the price averages, BSV keeps failing to break past the 50-day average around $34.87, showing that bears are still pretty much in control of prices in longer time trends.

A surprise bullish wave in the broader cryptocurrency market has seen prices edge higher on Friday, underscored by a spike in sentiment amid tensions in the Middle East. Major digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), are upholding a bullish outlook, offering signs of a prolonged trend reversal heading into the weekend.
Sentiment in the cryptocurrency market surged after United States (US) President Donald Trump, through his White House press secretary, announced a two-week delay in the decision on whether to launch attacks on Iran. 
Meanwhile, key European leaders, including the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and Germany, are set to meet with Iranian Foreign Minister, Abbas Araqchi, in Geneva on Friday. The meeting, expected to be attended by the European Union (EU) foreign policy chief, will focus primarily on nuclear and regional issues.
Friday marks a week since the strikes between Israel and Iran began, which have seen global Crude Oil prices escalate, raising concerns about an economic slowdown in the face of tariffs and related deadlines in the US.
Interest from institutional investors has remained firm despite geopolitical tensions. This has been reflected in the steady inflows into US Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). SoSoValue shows the total net inflow of spot BTC ETFs at almost $47 billion and net assets of $127 billion, accumulated since January 2024. 
BlackRock's IBIT is the most valuable spot ETF, with near $51 billion in net inflow volume and $71 million in net assets. Fidelity currently holds the second position with almost $12 billion in net inflow and $20 billion in net assets. Grayscale's GBTC has stabilized at around $23 billion in net inflow volume and $19 billion in net assets after facing massive withdrawals.

Inflows in Ethereum have also been steady over the last few weeks, sending the cumulative total to $3.9 billion. BlackRock's ETHA ETF accounts for the lion's share of the net cumulative inflows at $5 billion, followed closely by Fidelity's FETH with $1.15 billion.

An increase near 5% in the Ethereum derivatives market Open Interest (OI) to $37 billion over the last 24 hours reflects a slightly improving sentiment around US President Trump's adamant stance on joining the Israel-Iran conflict. Liquidations of short positions edged higher on Friday, reaching $21 million over 24 hours compared to $10 million in longs.

QCP Capital's market update highlights a more cautious approach from investors, hinting at ""risk reversals in BTC and ETH."" 
""Price action remains muted despite rising macro uncertainty and the familiar din of political noise from Trump's social media machine. Investor sentiment remains on pause, and positioning suggests that market participants are biding their time for a more decisive catalyst,"" QCP Capital market update states.
The Bitcoin price shows signs of extending its recovery significantly above $106,000 at the time of writing, underpinned by support from the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $103,242.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reversal above the 50 midline underscores bullish momentum. A prolonged upside move toward overbought territory would increase the probability of a weekend rally targeting resistance at $107,624, which capped the price on Wednesday, the psychological whole number of $110,000 and the record high at around $110,982.
BTC/USD daily chart
The largest smart contracts token by market capitalization, Ethereum, is trading at $2,552 at the time of writing, up over 1% on the day. ETH's price remains firmly above key levels, including the 200-day EMA support, currently at $2,477, the 50-day EMA at $2,443, and the 100-day EMA at $2,375. 
The RSI above the midline supports the uptrend, with key areas of interest to traders, including $2,881, a resistance level tested on June 11, and $3,000, which was previously tested as support in November.
ETH/USDT daily & XRP/USDT daily charts 
Sideways trading is taking center stage, with the price of XRP hovering at around $2.17 at the time of writing. XRP boasts robust support provided by the 200-day EMA at $2.09 but faces confluence resistance at $2.24, formed by the 50-day EMA and the 200-day EMA, which caps the upside movement.
A break on either side of the support and resistance would determine the direction of the trend. Sliding below the 200-day EMA at $2.09 could create instability and potentially increase the possibility of a breakdown under $2.00. 
On the contrary, recovery beyond the $2.24 confluence level could boost XRP's bullish odds and expand the scope to $2.65, a level previously tested in May as resistance and the seller congestion at $3.00, tested as support in early March.
Token launches influence demand and adoption among market participants. Listings on crypto exchanges deepen the liquidity for an asset and add new participants to an asset’s network. This is typically bullish for a digital asset. 
A hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. The exploiter then transfers these tokens out of the exchange platforms to ultimately sell or swap the assets for other cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets.
Macroeconomic events like the US Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates influence crypto assets mainly through the direct impact they have on the US Dollar. An increase in interest rate typically negatively influences Bitcoin and altcoin prices, and vice versa. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher.
Halvings are typically considered bullish events as they slash the block reward in half for miners, constricting the supply of the asset. At consistent demand if the supply reduces, the asset’s price climbs.

Bitcoin (BTC) price remains steady above a key support level, trading slightly above $106,000 at the time of writing on Friday. The uncertainty looms as geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel show no sign yet of an exit strategy from either side. US President Donald Trump is expected to decide within two weeks on a potential role for the US in the Israel-Iran conflict. Despite the cautious sentiment, corporate and institutional interest in BTC held firm so far this week.
The ongoing war between Iran and Israel, which has been taking place since last week, continued to escalate with no sign yet of an exit strategy from either side. Bitcoin's price action remained broadly resilient at the start of the week on Monday despite escalating tensions in the Middle East. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization held above its key psychological threshold of 100,000 despite the initial shock, compared to April last year, when BTC fell more than 8% amid similar Iran-Israel turmoil. 
However, on Tuesday, BTC declined 2.10% as news emerged that President Trump had stated on social media that the US was aware of the location of the Iran’s leader but was choosing not to take any action, and then added, “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!” according to the Wall Street Journal. 
Moreover, Israeli Channel 12 media outlet reportedly said on Tuesday that the US could join the war against Iran that same night.
BTC price consolidated over the next two days as the US didn't take any military action against Iran, hinting at some sign of relief for investors.
Later on Friday, Reuters reported that Trump will decide in the next two weeks whether the US will get involved in the Israel-Iran war. As of now, the US possible strike on Iran remains calm, which pushes the BTC price slightly up, trading around $106,000 at the time of writing on Friday.
However, further escalation or US intervention could lead to a disruption in the cryptocurrency market, resulting in a sharp correction in the Bitcoin price.
The US Federal Reserve (Fed) kept its interest rate unchanged at the 4.25%–4.50% range at its June meeting on Wednesday, as widely expected. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) still sees around 50 basis points of rate cuts through the end of 2025.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that ongoing policy uncertainty will keep the Fed in a rate-hold stance, and any rate cuts will be contingent on labor and inflation data. The markets remained neutral on this news, as an unchanged interest rate was highly expected. 
On Thursday, US President Trump posted on his Truth Social account, “Too Late—Powell is the WORST. A real dummy, who’s costing America $Billions!”

The US Senate passed the GENIUS bill on Tuesday and now awaits final deliberation in the House before it can move on to the President's desk. 
The US Senate’s decision on a stablecoin regulatory bill marks a milestone for the crypto industry. This decision has a positive outlook, as it helps establish a legal framework for stablecoins, which could enhance their legitimacy and facilitate wider adoption. Additionally, this could also boost the stablecoin market capitalization, which is considered the crypto gateway and has a positive correlation with Bitcoin price.
Moreover, Arizona’s Bitcoin reserve bill HB2324, which initially failed, has been revived after the state’s Senate passed a motion to reconsider the bill on Thursday. This bill would establish a fund from digital assets seized through criminal asset forfeiture. It has passed the Senate with a 16-14 vote and is now in the House.

CryptoQuant's weekly report highlights the fading demand for Bitcoin. According to the Bitcoin Apparent Demand chart, the growth is 118,000 in the last 30 days, down from its previous peak of 228,000 reached on May 27. Additionally, the demand has fallen below its 30-day Moving Average, indicating that the demand for Bitcoin is softening.

The chart below shows that the demand for new BTC entrants has also weakened, with its demand momentum turning sharply negative, further supporting a bearish thesis.

The analyst projects that if demand continues to weaken, Bitcoin could find support near $92,000, as shown in the chart below.

Despite the rising uncertainty in the market, institutional and corporate demand for Bitcoin remained robust as of this week. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet announced on Monday that it had purchased an additional 1,112 BTC, bringing the total holding to 10,000 BTC. On the same day, Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, announced that it had added 10,100 BTC for $1.05 billion at an average price of $104,080 per BTC. The firm currently holds 592,100 BTC.
Later on Thursday, Semler Scientific announced its three-year plan to boost its Bitcoin holdings to 105,000 BTC by the end of 2027. The firm currently holds 3,808 BTC, as reported in its first-quarter financial statements.
The corporate interest in Bitcoin indicates a growing acceptance of BTC as a strategic asset, which boosts its legitimacy and potentially drives long-term adoption.
Institutional demand for Bitcoin has remained strong so far this week. According to SoSoValue data, US spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have recorded a total inflow of $1.02 billion so far this week, continuing their two-week streak of inflows.

Bitcoin price drew liquidity from its Fair Value Gap (FVG) around $108,064 on Monday and declined by 2.10% the following day. BTC has tested and found support multiple times around the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at approximately $103,200, highlighting its strength as a dynamic support. At the time of writing on Friday, BTC recovers slightly, trading at $106,400.
If BTC continues its correction and closes below the 50-day EMA at $103,200 on a daily basis, it could extend the decline to retest its key psychologically important level at $100,000.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum indicator on the daily chart is steading just above its neutral level of 50, reading 52, which indicates indecisiveness among investors. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator displayed a bearish crossover last week. It also shows rising red histogram bars below its neutral level, indicating bearish momentum and giving credence to a downward trend.

However, if BTC closes above its FVG level at $108,064, it could extend the recovery toward retesting the May 22 all-time high of $111,980.

Alongside, the company — which currently holds 4,449 bitcoin worth about $462 million — announced a goal of owning at least 10,000 bitcoin by the end of this year, 42,000 by year-end 2026 and 105,000 by year-end 2027.
""We are excited to have Joe join our Bitcoin strategy team and help drive our three-year-plan to own 105,000 Bitcoins,"" said company Chairman Eric Semler in a press release. ""Joe is an analytical thought leader on Bitcoin and Bitcoin treasury companies. His expertise will be instrumental as we pursue our Bitcoin treasury strategy and aim to deliver long-term value to our stockholders.""
""For over seven years, [Joe] has publicly been making the case for Bitcoin as the world's most advanced form of monetary technology,"" the release continued. ""He previously served as director of market research at Unchained, a Bitcoin-focused financial services company.""
Investors, for now, are applauding the news, sending SMLR higher by 14% on Friday even as bitcoin has dipped back below $104,000 and most BTC-related stocks are trading in the red.
Prior to today, though, it's been a rough ride for SMLR, which remains lower by 33% year-to-date and more than 50% off its 2025 high above $80. The sharp share price decline has left the company's market capitalization at or below the value of the bitcoin on its balance sheet — thus taking off the table the ability to accretively raise money for more BTC purchases through common share sales.
The hiring of Burnett and lofty BTC acquisition goals suggests Semler is likely to get creative with capital raising plans, perhaps — in similar fashion to Michael Saylor's Strategy — turning to the preferred share market.
Stephen is CoinDesk's managing editor for Markets. He previously served as managing editor at Seeking Alpha. A native of suburban Washington, D.C., Stephen went to the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, majoring in finance. He holds BTC above CoinDesk’s disclosure threshold of $1,000.

At press time, bitcoin had pared some of the losses, returning to $103,200, down 1.2% over the past 24 hours.
Other large cryptocurrencies endured steeper declines. Ethereum's ether ETH$2,399.67 saw a sharp 4.5% drop in just 90 minutes to as low as $2,372, with trading volume spiking to nearly 800,000 ETH, nearly eight times the average hourly volume, per CoinDesk data. Solana's SOL SOL$138.73, dogecoin DOGE$0.15916 and Cardano's ADA ADA$0.57160 were 3%-5% lower over the same period.
The volatility burst caught many traders off-guard, liquidating about $450 million in derivatives trading positions on centralized exchanges across all digital assets, CoinGlass data shows. Some $387 million of liquidations were tied to long positions that bet on profiting from rising prices.
While macro risks abound — among them the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran — there was no immediate external reason for the sudden price swing. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 indexes only inched lower during the day.
Zooming out, BTC continues to trade within a sideways range between $100,000 and $110,000, consolidating just below its all-time record level.
""The mixed view of whether BTC will go above $110,000 again or drop into the $90,000 area doesn’t surprise me at all and underscores the overall indecision people and markets feel,"" said James Toledano, chief operating officer at Unity Wallet.
""The present BTC stalemate reflects a market caught between bullish long-term sentiment and short-term macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty,"" he added.

For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.
As Asia begins its trading day, bitcoin BTC$103,059.65 is trading above $104,500 and, despite a possible looming war in the Middle East, has been relatively flat on the day with negligible market movement. Indeed, for the last full week, BTC is only down 2%, according to CoinDesk market data.
Analysts are debating whether the crypto market’s current stillness is a sign of strength or if something more precarious is afoot.
Three new reports this week from CryptoQuant, Glassnode, and trading firm Flowdesk all point to the same surface conditions: low volatility, tight price action, and subdued on-chain activity. Additionally, retail participation has waned, and institutional players, from ETFs to whales, are now shaping the structure of flows.
But it’s CryptoQuant that’s flashing the most urgent warning.
In its June 19 report, CryptoQuant argued that BTC could soon revisit $92,000 support or even fall as low as $81,000 if demand continues to deteriorate.
Spot demand is still increasing, but well below trend. ETF flows have dropped by more than 60% since April, while whale accumulation has halved. Short-term holders, who are usually newer market participants, have shed approximately 800,000 BTC since late May.
Their demand momentum indicator, which tracks directional buying strength across key cohorts, is now reading negative 2 million BTC, the lowest in CryptoQuant’s dataset.
Glassnode, however, sees the same signals and arrives at a far less dire conclusion.
In its weekly on-chain update, the firm acknowledges that the Bitcoin blockchain is “quiet,"" meaning transaction counts are down, fees are minimal, and miner revenue is subdued.
However, this suggests that it may not be a weakness, but rather a reflection of the network’s evolution. On-chain settlement volume remains high, but it’s concentrated in large-value transfers, suggesting the chain is increasingly being used by institutions and whales.
The derivatives market, Glassnode notes, now dwarfs on-chain activity, with futures and options volumes regularly exceeding spot by 7x–16x.
That shift has brought more sophisticated hedging, better collateral practices, and a more mature, if less frenetic, market structure.
France-based Flowdesk, a market maker and trading firm, has views that fall somewhere in between.
While noting thinning altcoin flows and flat market-making volumes, its June 19 update describes the market as “coiled,” not cracking.
Flowdesk highlights a surge in tokenized assets, such as Gold-backed XAUT (up 56% in volume), stablecoin growth, and increasing RWA activity.
To them, low volatility may simply be the calm before a directional breakout, which is not necessarily downwards.
But in the end, no one seems to hold a reliable map for what’s ahead.
Even Polymarket bettors aren't sure as there is  a near equal chance of BTC dropping to $90K in June or moving up to $115K-120K.
One thing is for sure: the tug-of-war between bullish institutional activities and waning retail demand potentially opens bitcoin up to dramatic moves on either side of the trade, which will likely dictate the market’s next chapter.
A new report from Presto Research argues that Crypto Treasury Companies (CTCs), such as Strategy and Metaplanet, are not just leveraged bitcoin ETFs, but a new form of financial engineering with less risk than many investors assume.
Strategy’s latest raise, which raised nearly $1 billion via perpetual preferred shares, shows how BTC’s volatility can be used to an issuer’s advantage.
These securities, along with convertible bonds and at-the-market equity sales, allow CTCs to fund aggressive crypto accumulation without triggering margin risk.
Presto points out that Strategy’s BTC is unpledged and Metaplanet’s bonds are unsecured, meaning collateral liquidation, the primary trigger in past crypto blowups like Celsius and Three Arrows, is largely absent here. That does not eliminate risk, but it changes the nature of it.
The real challenge, Presto argues, is not crypto exposure itself but the discipline to manage dilution, cash flow, and capital timing.
Metaplanet’s “bitcoin yield” metric, which measures BTC per fully diluted share, reflects that focus on shareholder value.
As long as CTCs can manage the financial mechanics behind their accumulation strategies, they will earn NAV premiums just like high-growth companies in traditional markets. But if they miscalculate, the same tools that fuel their rise could accelerate their fall.
Semler Scientific (Nasdaq: SMLR) has unveiled one of the most aggressive bitcoin accumulation roadmaps in corporate history, announcing plans to hold 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, 42,000 by 2026, and a staggering 105,000 by the close of 2027.
The California-based medical device maker, which pivoted to a bitcoin treasury strategy last year, is effectively trying to increase its current bitcoin stash of 4,449 coins by more than two fold over the next 30 months.
It plans to do so using a mix of equity raises, debt financing, and operational cash flow.
There aren't specific details of how the company plans to fund the buy. Hwever, historically Semler’s primary mechanism for acquiring bitcoin was selling new shares under its at-the-market (ATM) program, which relies on the company trading at a premium to its net asset value (NAV).
According to data from Strategy-Tracker, Semler’s mNAV currently sits at 0.859x, meaning the market values the firm’s equity lower than its BTC holdings, which could be cutting off its ability to raise accretive capital.
How this dynamic plays out, would be worth watching as the firm initiates more bitcoin buying. Even as bitcoin has surged to all-time highs above $100,000, Semler shares are down nearly 40% on the year.

The move puts BCH within striking distance of the psychologically critical $500 level — a zone last touched during April's breakout attempt.
If momentum persists, BCH could attempt to flip $500 into a long-term support — a move that could change its macro structure heading into Q3.
BCH rallied from $461.87 to a high of $492.08 over 24 hours, backed by strong inflows. The breakout began in earnest during the 13:00–14:00 window, when volume spiked to 152,140 units — more than five times the hourly average — confirming institutional buying.
The price rejected off the $500 barrier multiple times, slipping to $490.46 during the early morning session before stabilizing. A brief sell-off at 04:51 triggered a quick dip to $491.47, but price soon reclaimed $485, showing signs of resilience and consolidation just below key resistance.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is hovering above the key support level on Friday; a breach below this level could trigger a sharp decline. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) followed BTC’s footsteps and stabilized around their crucial levels, with a failure below their support levels indicating a potential correction ahead.
Traders remain cautious as President Donald Trump is expected to decide within two weeks whether the US will intervene in the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict, a move that could decide the risk sentiment toward crypto markets.
Bitcoin price drew liquidity from its Fair Value Gap (FVG) around $108,064 on Monday and declined by 2.1% the following day. BTC has retested and found support multiple times around the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at approximately $103,100, highlighting its strength as dynamic support. At the time of writing on Friday, it trades at around $104,500.
If BTC continues its correction and closes below the 50-day EMA at $103,100 on a daily basis, it could extend the decline to retest its key psychologically important level at $100,000.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum indicator on the daily chart reads 47, below its neutral level of 50, indicating that bearish momentum is gaining traction. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator displayed a bearish crossover last week. It also shows rising red histogram bars below its neutral level, indicating bearish momentum and giving credence to the downward trend.
BTC/USDT daily chart
However, if BTC closes above its FVG level at $108,064, it could extend the recovery toward retesting its May 22 all-time high of $111,980.
Ethereum price retested and found support around its 50-day EMA at $2,441 on Wednesday, consolidating at this level the following day. This level coincides with the lower consolidation boundary of $2,461, making it a key support zone. At the time of writing on Friday, it hovers at around $2,514.
If ETH closes below the 50-day EMA at $2,441, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $2,000.
The RSI on the daily chart momentum indicator reads 48, below its neutral level of 50, indicating that bearish momentum is gaining traction. The MACD indicator displayed a bearish crossover last week. It also shows rising red histogram bars below its neutral level, indicating bearish momentum and giving credence to the downward trend.
ETH/USDT daily chart
On the contrary, if ETH finds support around its 50-day EMA at $2,441 and recovers, it could extend the recovery to retest its upper consolidation boundary at $2,724.
XRP price attempted to close above the 50-day EMA at $2.24 on Monday but failed, subsequently declining by 3.53% the following day and consolidating around the $2.15 level until Thursday. At the time of writing on Friday, it hovers around $2.16.
If XRP faces a correction, it could extend the decline to retest its next daily support level at $1.96.
The RSI on the daily chart reads 44, below its neutral level and points downward, indicating strong bearish momentum. Moreover, the MACD indicator on the daily chart displayed a bearish crossover, signaling a sell and indicating a downward trend.
XRP/USDT daily chart
However, if XRP recovers and closes above the 50-day EMA at $2.24, it could extend the recovery toward the May 23 high of $2.47.
Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.
Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 
Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

The adoption of cryptocurrency-related financial products, including tokenized treasuries, is on overdrive globally, with the focus now shifting to robust networks such as Ripple's XRP Ledger (XRPL).
Sei extends gains above $0.21, decoupling the token from the broader crypto market amid low sentiment and macroeconomic uncertainty. The Wyoming Stable Token Commission selects Sei Network as a candidate blockchain for the WYST, the first fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a US state.
Bitcoin bulls step up, pushing the price above $106,000, as Trump said he would delay his decision about launching strikes on Iran for up to two weeks. Ethereum rebounds from the 200-day EMA support at $2,477 amid steady interest in the derivatives market.
Solana experiences a minor uptick of under 1% at press time on Friday, with multiple long shadow candles forming above $140 as bearish momentum fades off. The optimism surrounding Solana is on the rise, as evidenced by the SOL Open Interest reaching a weekly high.
Bitcoin (BTC) price remains steady above a key support level, trading slightly above $106,000 at the time of writing on Friday. The uncertainty looms as geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel show no sign yet of an exit strategy from either side.

Bitcoin BTC$102,982.16 hovered near $104,700 during Asia hours, slipping 1.2% over 24 hours, while ether ETH$2,398.32 traded just below $2,860, down 1.8% on the day.
The soft price action tracks with broader macro unease following Wednesday’s FOMC hold, where the Fed kept rates unchanged but reiterated a cautious, inflation-sensitive stance.
Historically subdued during the June-July stretch, crypto markets have entered a lull with BTC front-end implied volumes slipping under 40%, erasing the risk premium from recent geopolitical tension, Singapore-based QCP Capital noted in a Thursday market broadcast.
Open interest across BTC and ETH perps remains flat, and option markets skew negative, with puts trading at a premium to calls – a sign of traders hedging against short-term pullbacks.
“There’s been no change to the technical picture, which remains supportive of another push to the topside,” said Joel Kruger, strategist at LMAX Group, in an email to CoinDesk. “BTC continues to consolidate bullishly, and a move through recent highs could set up a run toward $145,000.”
Ether still lags its 2021 highs but is gaining momentum, he added. “Clearing $2,900 could bring $3,400 into play,” Kruger said.
One bright spot for crypto is the U.S. Senate’s passage of a stablecoin framework, which adds another building block to what is becoming a more regulatory-friendly global environment. That’s reinforced a broader institutional conviction.
“Globally, we’re seeing continued progress that promises greater clarity and a more welcoming environment for institutional crypto adoption,” Kruger added.
Still, the near-term setup remains cautious. Month-end OPEX flows, systematic rebalancing, and a lack of fresh catalysts could keep BTC stuck in its $ 102,000–$ 108,000 band for now.
But with H2 historically strong for crypto, some desks are already looking ahead. “The worst may be behind us,” Kruger said. “And the next leg up could catch many off guard.”

Here's something you don't see every day: Bitcoin's lesser-known cousins are stealing the show while the king of crypto takes a nap.
Bitcoin Cash has gone absolutely ballistic, rocketing 98% since its low point in April and trying to break the $500 resistance mark for good. Meanwhile, Bitcoin SV—yes, that controversial fork led by Satoshi pretender Craig Wright—is quietly climbing.
This rotation reflects broader market dynamics, with the S&P 500 on Friday hitting 6,000 points for the first time since February, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq approaches its own record near 20,000 as short-term traders appear to have priced in the panic over the current geopolitical events.
The Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates steady at 4.25%-4.5% on Wednesday has created a wait-and-see environment, with policymakers noting that ""uncertainty about the economic outlook has diminished, but remains elevated.""
Meanwhile, oil prices climbed over 4% on Tuesday as the Iran-Israel conflict raged, with Brent crude settling at $76.45—a development that traditionally correlates with crypto volatility, but has yet to significantly impact digital asset prices in the days since.
Bitcoin is putting investors to sleep with a 2% to $103,154 over the last week. The flagship cryptocurrency has entered a critical consolidation phase after failing to reclaim the $108,000-$109,000 resistance zone.
For traders watching the tape, this sideways grind often comes before the fireworks—for good or bad.
The weekly chart reveals a market in equilibrium, with several key indicators painting a nuanced picture:
RSI (Relative Strength Index): At 62 on the weekly time frame, Bitcoin shows mild bullish momentum without approaching overbought territory. The RSI measures the speed and magnitude of price changes: readings above 70 typically indicate overbought conditions where traders might expect a pullback, while below 30 suggests oversold levels that could precede a bounce. Bitcoin's current reading indicates healthy bullish momentum that could support further upside.
ADX (Average Directional Index): Reading 26, the ADX has just crossed the crucial 25 threshold, suggesting a trend is beginning to form in longer time frames. This indicator measures trend strength regardless of direction: below 20 indicates no trend, 20-25 shows a developing trend, and above 25 confirms trend establishment. For momentum traders, this crossing above 25 could signal the start of a more decisive move.
Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs): Bitcoin currently trades above its 50-week EMA (the average price of the last 50 weeks—basically one year), but faces resistance from the convergence of multiple time frames. The 50-200 EMA spread remains positive, which technical analysts often interpret as a bullish market structure. When shorter-term averages stay above longer-term ones, it typically indicates sustained buying pressure.
Squeeze Momentum Indicator: The ""off"" status on the weekly chart suggests volatility has already been released, contradicting the daily chart's compression. This divergence between time frames often precedes significant moves as different trader cohorts position themselves.
Key Levels:
Bitcoin Cash is the week's star performer with a commanding 14.57% surge to $483, briefly breaking past the psychologically significant $500 level—but it’s been unable to maintain momentum. BCH social media mentions surged as the price began to recover, pushing it to a new peak for 2025.
The weekly chart presents a compelling bullish case with room for continuation, with some cautions needed, of course:
RSI at 63: This reading places BCH in what traders often call the ""power zone"" —strong enough to indicate genuine momentum, but not yet extended enough to trigger profit-taking. Historical analysis shows BCH tends to run until RSI reaches 75-80, suggesting approximately 20% additional upside potential before overbought conditions emerge. That would match the resistance of the current triangle that has been in place since April.
ADX at 18: While below the 25 trend confirmation level, this reading shows that markets are fighting to push prices forward. However, this might not be a bad signal, and interpretation will vary as the indicator is analyzed alongside other readings. Low ADX readings after a strong move often indicate consolidation before the next leg higher. Traders might interpret this as the market digesting gains before attempting the next resistance level.
Moving Average Configuration: BCH trades decisively above both its 50-week and 200-week EMAs, with increasing separation between them. This expanding gap, known as moving average divergence, typically indicates strong trending conditions. The 50-week EMA near $385 now serves as dynamic support, while the 200-week mark at $352 provides a floor for any deeper corrections.
Key Levels:

BSV's 6% weekly gain to $31.47 since last Friday's low might look like small potatoes next to BCH's moonshot, but context is everything. The controversial fork is now trading 30% above its June lows despite persistent skepticism, finishing the week as the seventh-best performing cryptocurrency among the top 100. However, today's correction is giving signs of a flat performance if the week's shadows are not considered.
BSV's chart is like reading tea leaves, but here's what technical traders are seeing.
The RSI at 43 is slightly bearish but not terrible. Think of it as a car running on fumes, but not quite empty. Some contrarian traders love buying when RSI is this low, as they're betting on a bounce. History shows BSV often bottoms between 35-40, so we're in the danger zone where brave souls start nibbling.
Also, the ADX at 19 is yet another weak trend reading that creates a coiled spring scenario. When ADX readings remain below 20 for extended periods, the eventual breakout (in either direction) tends to be violent. Range traders might play the boundaries, while trend followers await confirmation above 25.
As for the price averages, BSV keeps failing to break past the 50-day average around $34.87, showing that bears are still pretty much in control of prices in longer time trends.

A surprise bullish wave in the broader cryptocurrency market has seen prices edge higher on Friday, underscored by a spike in sentiment amid tensions in the Middle East. Major digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), are upholding a bullish outlook, offering signs of a prolonged trend reversal heading into the weekend.
Sentiment in the cryptocurrency market surged after United States (US) President Donald Trump, through his White House press secretary, announced a two-week delay in the decision on whether to launch attacks on Iran. 
Meanwhile, key European leaders, including the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and Germany, are set to meet with Iranian Foreign Minister, Abbas Araqchi, in Geneva on Friday. The meeting, expected to be attended by the European Union (EU) foreign policy chief, will focus primarily on nuclear and regional issues.
Friday marks a week since the strikes between Israel and Iran began, which have seen global Crude Oil prices escalate, raising concerns about an economic slowdown in the face of tariffs and related deadlines in the US.
Interest from institutional investors has remained firm despite geopolitical tensions. This has been reflected in the steady inflows into US Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). SoSoValue shows the total net inflow of spot BTC ETFs at almost $47 billion and net assets of $127 billion, accumulated since January 2024. 
BlackRock's IBIT is the most valuable spot ETF, with near $51 billion in net inflow volume and $71 million in net assets. Fidelity currently holds the second position with almost $12 billion in net inflow and $20 billion in net assets. Grayscale's GBTC has stabilized at around $23 billion in net inflow volume and $19 billion in net assets after facing massive withdrawals.

Inflows in Ethereum have also been steady over the last few weeks, sending the cumulative total to $3.9 billion. BlackRock's ETHA ETF accounts for the lion's share of the net cumulative inflows at $5 billion, followed closely by Fidelity's FETH with $1.15 billion.

An increase near 5% in the Ethereum derivatives market Open Interest (OI) to $37 billion over the last 24 hours reflects a slightly improving sentiment around US President Trump's adamant stance on joining the Israel-Iran conflict. Liquidations of short positions edged higher on Friday, reaching $21 million over 24 hours compared to $10 million in longs.

QCP Capital's market update highlights a more cautious approach from investors, hinting at ""risk reversals in BTC and ETH."" 
""Price action remains muted despite rising macro uncertainty and the familiar din of political noise from Trump's social media machine. Investor sentiment remains on pause, and positioning suggests that market participants are biding their time for a more decisive catalyst,"" QCP Capital market update states.
The Bitcoin price shows signs of extending its recovery significantly above $106,000 at the time of writing, underpinned by support from the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $103,242.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reversal above the 50 midline underscores bullish momentum. A prolonged upside move toward overbought territory would increase the probability of a weekend rally targeting resistance at $107,624, which capped the price on Wednesday, the psychological whole number of $110,000 and the record high at around $110,982.
BTC/USD daily chart
The largest smart contracts token by market capitalization, Ethereum, is trading at $2,552 at the time of writing, up over 1% on the day. ETH's price remains firmly above key levels, including the 200-day EMA support, currently at $2,477, the 50-day EMA at $2,443, and the 100-day EMA at $2,375. 
The RSI above the midline supports the uptrend, with key areas of interest to traders, including $2,881, a resistance level tested on June 11, and $3,000, which was previously tested as support in November.
ETH/USDT daily & XRP/USDT daily charts 
Sideways trading is taking center stage, with the price of XRP hovering at around $2.17 at the time of writing. XRP boasts robust support provided by the 200-day EMA at $2.09 but faces confluence resistance at $2.24, formed by the 50-day EMA and the 200-day EMA, which caps the upside movement.
A break on either side of the support and resistance would determine the direction of the trend. Sliding below the 200-day EMA at $2.09 could create instability and potentially increase the possibility of a breakdown under $2.00. 
On the contrary, recovery beyond the $2.24 confluence level could boost XRP's bullish odds and expand the scope to $2.65, a level previously tested in May as resistance and the seller congestion at $3.00, tested as support in early March.
Token launches influence demand and adoption among market participants. Listings on crypto exchanges deepen the liquidity for an asset and add new participants to an asset’s network. This is typically bullish for a digital asset. 
A hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. The exploiter then transfers these tokens out of the exchange platforms to ultimately sell or swap the assets for other cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets.
Macroeconomic events like the US Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates influence crypto assets mainly through the direct impact they have on the US Dollar. An increase in interest rate typically negatively influences Bitcoin and altcoin prices, and vice versa. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher.
Halvings are typically considered bullish events as they slash the block reward in half for miners, constricting the supply of the asset. At consistent demand if the supply reduces, the asset’s price climbs.

Bitcoin (BTC) price remains steady above a key support level, trading slightly above $106,000 at the time of writing on Friday. The uncertainty looms as geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel show no sign yet of an exit strategy from either side. US President Donald Trump is expected to decide within two weeks on a potential role for the US in the Israel-Iran conflict. Despite the cautious sentiment, corporate and institutional interest in BTC held firm so far this week.
The ongoing war between Iran and Israel, which has been taking place since last week, continued to escalate with no sign yet of an exit strategy from either side. Bitcoin's price action remained broadly resilient at the start of the week on Monday despite escalating tensions in the Middle East. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization held above its key psychological threshold of 100,000 despite the initial shock, compared to April last year, when BTC fell more than 8% amid similar Iran-Israel turmoil. 
However, on Tuesday, BTC declined 2.10% as news emerged that President Trump had stated on social media that the US was aware of the location of the Iran’s leader but was choosing not to take any action, and then added, “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!” according to the Wall Street Journal. 
Moreover, Israeli Channel 12 media outlet reportedly said on Tuesday that the US could join the war against Iran that same night.
BTC price consolidated over the next two days as the US didn't take any military action against Iran, hinting at some sign of relief for investors.
Later on Friday, Reuters reported that Trump will decide in the next two weeks whether the US will get involved in the Israel-Iran war. As of now, the US possible strike on Iran remains calm, which pushes the BTC price slightly up, trading around $106,000 at the time of writing on Friday.
However, further escalation or US intervention could lead to a disruption in the cryptocurrency market, resulting in a sharp correction in the Bitcoin price.
The US Federal Reserve (Fed) kept its interest rate unchanged at the 4.25%–4.50% range at its June meeting on Wednesday, as widely expected. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) still sees around 50 basis points of rate cuts through the end of 2025.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that ongoing policy uncertainty will keep the Fed in a rate-hold stance, and any rate cuts will be contingent on labor and inflation data. The markets remained neutral on this news, as an unchanged interest rate was highly expected. 
On Thursday, US President Trump posted on his Truth Social account, “Too Late—Powell is the WORST. A real dummy, who’s costing America $Billions!”

The US Senate passed the GENIUS bill on Tuesday and now awaits final deliberation in the House before it can move on to the President's desk. 
The US Senate’s decision on a stablecoin regulatory bill marks a milestone for the crypto industry. This decision has a positive outlook, as it helps establish a legal framework for stablecoins, which could enhance their legitimacy and facilitate wider adoption. Additionally, this could also boost the stablecoin market capitalization, which is considered the crypto gateway and has a positive correlation with Bitcoin price.
Moreover, Arizona’s Bitcoin reserve bill HB2324, which initially failed, has been revived after the state’s Senate passed a motion to reconsider the bill on Thursday. This bill would establish a fund from digital assets seized through criminal asset forfeiture. It has passed the Senate with a 16-14 vote and is now in the House.

CryptoQuant's weekly report highlights the fading demand for Bitcoin. According to the Bitcoin Apparent Demand chart, the growth is 118,000 in the last 30 days, down from its previous peak of 228,000 reached on May 27. Additionally, the demand has fallen below its 30-day Moving Average, indicating that the demand for Bitcoin is softening.

The chart below shows that the demand for new BTC entrants has also weakened, with its demand momentum turning sharply negative, further supporting a bearish thesis.

The analyst projects that if demand continues to weaken, Bitcoin could find support near $92,000, as shown in the chart below.

Despite the rising uncertainty in the market, institutional and corporate demand for Bitcoin remained robust as of this week. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet announced on Monday that it had purchased an additional 1,112 BTC, bringing the total holding to 10,000 BTC. On the same day, Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, announced that it had added 10,100 BTC for $1.05 billion at an average price of $104,080 per BTC. The firm currently holds 592,100 BTC.
Later on Thursday, Semler Scientific announced its three-year plan to boost its Bitcoin holdings to 105,000 BTC by the end of 2027. The firm currently holds 3,808 BTC, as reported in its first-quarter financial statements.
The corporate interest in Bitcoin indicates a growing acceptance of BTC as a strategic asset, which boosts its legitimacy and potentially drives long-term adoption.
Institutional demand for Bitcoin has remained strong so far this week. According to SoSoValue data, US spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) have recorded a total inflow of $1.02 billion so far this week, continuing their two-week streak of inflows.

Bitcoin price drew liquidity from its Fair Value Gap (FVG) around $108,064 on Monday and declined by 2.10% the following day. BTC has tested and found support multiple times around the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at approximately $103,200, highlighting its strength as a dynamic support. At the time of writing on Friday, BTC recovers slightly, trading at $106,400.
If BTC continues its correction and closes below the 50-day EMA at $103,200 on a daily basis, it could extend the decline to retest its key psychologically important level at $100,000.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum indicator on the daily chart is steading just above its neutral level of 50, reading 52, which indicates indecisiveness among investors. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator displayed a bearish crossover last week. It also shows rising red histogram bars below its neutral level, indicating bearish momentum and giving credence to a downward trend.

However, if BTC closes above its FVG level at $108,064, it could extend the recovery toward retesting the May 22 all-time high of $111,980.

Alongside, the company — which currently holds 4,449 bitcoin worth about $462 million — announced a goal of owning at least 10,000 bitcoin by the end of this year, 42,000 by year-end 2026 and 105,000 by year-end 2027.
""We are excited to have Joe join our Bitcoin strategy team and help drive our three-year-plan to own 105,000 Bitcoins,"" said company Chairman Eric Semler in a press release. ""Joe is an analytical thought leader on Bitcoin and Bitcoin treasury companies. His expertise will be instrumental as we pursue our Bitcoin treasury strategy and aim to deliver long-term value to our stockholders.""
""For over seven years, [Joe] has publicly been making the case for Bitcoin as the world's most advanced form of monetary technology,"" the release continued. ""He previously served as director of market research at Unchained, a Bitcoin-focused financial services company.""
Investors, for now, are applauding the news, sending SMLR higher by 14% on Friday even as bitcoin has dipped back below $104,000 and most BTC-related stocks are trading in the red.
Prior to today, though, it's been a rough ride for SMLR, which remains lower by 33% year-to-date and more than 50% off its 2025 high above $80. The sharp share price decline has left the company's market capitalization at or below the value of the bitcoin on its balance sheet — thus taking off the table the ability to accretively raise money for more BTC purchases through common share sales.
The hiring of Burnett and lofty BTC acquisition goals suggests Semler is likely to get creative with capital raising plans, perhaps — in similar fashion to Michael Saylor's Strategy — turning to the preferred share market.
Stephen is CoinDesk's managing editor for Markets. He previously served as managing editor at Seeking Alpha. A native of suburban Washington, D.C., Stephen went to the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, majoring in finance. He holds BTC above CoinDesk’s disclosure threshold of $1,000.

At press time, bitcoin had pared some of the losses, returning to $103,200, down 1.2% over the past 24 hours.
Other large cryptocurrencies endured steeper declines. Ethereum's ether ETH$2,396.94 saw a sharp 4.5% drop in just 90 minutes to as low as $2,372, with trading volume spiking to nearly 800,000 ETH, nearly eight times the average hourly volume, per CoinDesk data. Solana's SOL SOL$138.08, dogecoin DOGE$0.15824 and Cardano's ADA ADA$0.56661 were 3%-5% lower over the same period.
The volatility burst caught many traders off-guard, liquidating about $450 million in derivatives trading positions on centralized exchanges across all digital assets, CoinGlass data shows. Some $387 million of liquidations were tied to long positions that bet on profiting from rising prices.
While macro risks abound — among them the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran — there was no immediate external reason for the sudden price swing. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 indexes only inched lower during the day.
Zooming out, BTC continues to trade within a sideways range between $100,000 and $110,000, consolidating just below its all-time record level.
""The mixed view of whether BTC will go above $110,000 again or drop into the $90,000 area doesn’t surprise me at all and underscores the overall indecision people and markets feel,"" said James Toledano, chief operating officer at Unity Wallet.
""The present BTC stalemate reflects a market caught between bullish long-term sentiment and short-term macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty,"" he added.

For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas.
As Asia begins its trading day, bitcoin BTC$102,550.26 is trading above $104,500 and, despite a possible looming war in the Middle East, has been relatively flat on the day with negligible market movement. Indeed, for the last full week, BTC is only down 2%, according to CoinDesk market data.
Analysts are debating whether the crypto market’s current stillness is a sign of strength or if something more precarious is afoot.
Three new reports this week from CryptoQuant, Glassnode, and trading firm Flowdesk all point to the same surface conditions: low volatility, tight price action, and subdued on-chain activity. Additionally, retail participation has waned, and institutional players, from ETFs to whales, are now shaping the structure of flows.
But it’s CryptoQuant that’s flashing the most urgent warning.
In its June 19 report, CryptoQuant argued that BTC could soon revisit $92,000 support or even fall as low as $81,000 if demand continues to deteriorate.
Spot demand is still increasing, but well below trend. ETF flows have dropped by more than 60% since April, while whale accumulation has halved. Short-term holders, who are usually newer market participants, have shed approximately 800,000 BTC since late May.
Their demand momentum indicator, which tracks directional buying strength across key cohorts, is now reading negative 2 million BTC, the lowest in CryptoQuant’s dataset.
Glassnode, however, sees the same signals and arrives at a far less dire conclusion.
In its weekly on-chain update, the firm acknowledges that the Bitcoin blockchain is “quiet,"" meaning transaction counts are down, fees are minimal, and miner revenue is subdued.
However, this suggests that it may not be a weakness, but rather a reflection of the network’s evolution. On-chain settlement volume remains high, but it’s concentrated in large-value transfers, suggesting the chain is increasingly being used by institutions and whales.
The derivatives market, Glassnode notes, now dwarfs on-chain activity, with futures and options volumes regularly exceeding spot by 7x–16x.
That shift has brought more sophisticated hedging, better collateral practices, and a more mature, if less frenetic, market structure.
France-based Flowdesk, a market maker and trading firm, has views that fall somewhere in between.
While noting thinning altcoin flows and flat market-making volumes, its June 19 update describes the market as “coiled,” not cracking.
Flowdesk highlights a surge in tokenized assets, such as Gold-backed XAUT (up 56% in volume), stablecoin growth, and increasing RWA activity.
To them, low volatility may simply be the calm before a directional breakout, which is not necessarily downwards.
But in the end, no one seems to hold a reliable map for what’s ahead.
Even Polymarket bettors aren't sure as there is  a near equal chance of BTC dropping to $90K in June or moving up to $115K-120K.
One thing is for sure: the tug-of-war between bullish institutional activities and waning retail demand potentially opens bitcoin up to dramatic moves on either side of the trade, which will likely dictate the market’s next chapter.
A new report from Presto Research argues that Crypto Treasury Companies (CTCs), such as Strategy and Metaplanet, are not just leveraged bitcoin ETFs, but a new form of financial engineering with less risk than many investors assume.
Strategy’s latest raise, which raised nearly $1 billion via perpetual preferred shares, shows how BTC’s volatility can be used to an issuer’s advantage.
These securities, along with convertible bonds and at-the-market equity sales, allow CTCs to fund aggressive crypto accumulation without triggering margin risk.
Presto points out that Strategy’s BTC is unpledged and Metaplanet’s bonds are unsecured, meaning collateral liquidation, the primary trigger in past crypto blowups like Celsius and Three Arrows, is largely absent here. That does not eliminate risk, but it changes the nature of it.
The real challenge, Presto argues, is not crypto exposure itself but the discipline to manage dilution, cash flow, and capital timing.
Metaplanet’s “bitcoin yield” metric, which measures BTC per fully diluted share, reflects that focus on shareholder value.
As long as CTCs can manage the financial mechanics behind their accumulation strategies, they will earn NAV premiums just like high-growth companies in traditional markets. But if they miscalculate, the same tools that fuel their rise could accelerate their fall.
Semler Scientific (Nasdaq: SMLR) has unveiled one of the most aggressive bitcoin accumulation roadmaps in corporate history, announcing plans to hold 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, 42,000 by 2026, and a staggering 105,000 by the close of 2027.
The California-based medical device maker, which pivoted to a bitcoin treasury strategy last year, is effectively trying to increase its current bitcoin stash of 4,449 coins by more than two fold over the next 30 months.
It plans to do so using a mix of equity raises, debt financing, and operational cash flow.
There aren't specific details of how the company plans to fund the buy. Hwever, historically Semler’s primary mechanism for acquiring bitcoin was selling new shares under its at-the-market (ATM) program, which relies on the company trading at a premium to its net asset value (NAV).
According to data from Strategy-Tracker, Semler’s mNAV currently sits at 0.859x, meaning the market values the firm’s equity lower than its BTC holdings, which could be cutting off its ability to raise accretive capital.
How this dynamic plays out, would be worth watching as the firm initiates more bitcoin buying. Even as bitcoin has surged to all-time highs above $100,000, Semler shares are down nearly 40% on the year.

The move puts BCH within striking distance of the psychologically critical $500 level — a zone last touched during April's breakout attempt.
If momentum persists, BCH could attempt to flip $500 into a long-term support — a move that could change its macro structure heading into Q3.
BCH rallied from $461.87 to a high of $492.08 over 24 hours, backed by strong inflows. The breakout began in earnest during the 13:00–14:00 window, when volume spiked to 152,140 units — more than five times the hourly average — confirming institutional buying.
The price rejected off the $500 barrier multiple times, slipping to $490.46 during the early morning session before stabilizing. A brief sell-off at 04:51 triggered a quick dip to $491.47, but price soon reclaimed $485, showing signs of resilience and consolidation just below key resistance.

Public Keys is a weekly roundup from Decrypt that tracks the key publicly traded crypto companies.
This week: Circle and Coinbase surge on stablecoin legislation movement, the Bitcoin treasury model raises concerns, and sources tell Decrypt that another crypto firm is eyeing an IPO this year.
It makes sense that this week’s Senate vote in favor of the GENIUS Act was great for stablecoin issuers—but Circle has gone above and beyond.
The company’s CRCL shares, which trade on the New York Stock Exchange, opened at $156.36 on Tuesday—the day of the Senate’s historic vote. Since then, the stock has skyrocketed, hitting a new peak just shy of $249 on Friday and finishing the day above $240.
For those keeping track, that means the company’s share price peaked at eight times that of its $31 IPO. It's been just over two weeks since CRCL started trading.
Circle has been helped along by the fact that Wall Street analysts can’t help but rate the company highly. Jeff Cantwell, a senior analyst at Seaport Research Partners, initiated coverage on CRCL today with a buy rating and $235 price target.
Circle made it to that target before the bell even rang, dipped, and then shot past it.
“Circle’s strategy is to build the largest, most widely used stablecoin network in the world... This strikes us as a ‘TAM/adoption’ story,” Cantwell wrote in a note shared with Decrypt. TAM is Wall Street shorthand for total addressable market. And Cantwell reckons most of his peers are underestimating just how big the stablecoin market will become.
“We think the overall stablecoin market cap will reach $500 billion by the end of next year; longer-term, we think it ultimately can reach $2 trillion,” he said. That would mean the $260 billion stablecoin market will double in the next six months.
Buckle up, kids.
For what it’s worth, Coinbase, which trades on the Nasdaq under the COIN ticker and co-founded USDC with Circle, has received its own GENIUS-inspired gains. Its stock rose about 30% this week and closed Friday above $308, up more than 4% on the day.
Michael Saylor, Strategy co-founder and chairman, famously quipped about Bitcoin, “There is no second best.” It’s even been turned into a song.
But it’s starting to look like Stategy’s Bitcoin treasury company blueprint is really difficult to follow—and that’s not for lack of Saylor & Co. trying to spread the gospel.
Earlier this week, Nasdaq-listed healthcare firm Semler Scientific appeared to be flashing warning signs to investors. On Tuesday, the company was valued at a razor-thin premium compared to its Bitcoin holdings. Its mNAV, or multiple-to-net asset value had fallen to 1.07.
mNAV is a rough measure of how much premium investors assign to its Bitcoin holdings.
Since Tuesday, Semler’s mNAV has improved slightly to 1.23, according to the company’s website.
That’s after the company said Friday morning that it wants to amass 105,000 Bitcoin by 2027. That pushed the stock to a closing price of $36.14, or 13% higher than its Wednesday close. But the company’s shares are still way below the $55.05 they were at the start of the year and half what they were in December, when shares were trading above $78.
Now financial services firm Fold is selling $250 million worth of shares in an effort to turn that cash into a BTC treasury. The company’s shares were trading for $4.57 when it made its announcement on Tuesday. By Friday afternoon, they had slipped to $4.50.
Funny enough, the Bitcoin treasury companies with the best unrealized gains are Tesla and Block, Inc.. The companies have an average cost basis of $33,539 and $30,405, respectively, which means their holdings have net unrealized gains that are more than three times what they paid.
Block has never sold any of its Bitcoin, but Tesla’s unrealized gains could have been even higher. Remember: The company sold 75% of its BTC in 2022, when BTC was trading around $24,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is hovering above the key support level on Friday; a breach below this level could trigger a sharp decline. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) followed BTC’s footsteps and stabilized around their crucial levels, with a failure below their support levels indicating a potential correction ahead.
Traders remain cautious as President Donald Trump is expected to decide within two weeks whether the US will intervene in the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict, a move that could decide the risk sentiment toward crypto markets.
Bitcoin price drew liquidity from its Fair Value Gap (FVG) around $108,064 on Monday and declined by 2.1% the following day. BTC has retested and found support multiple times around the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at approximately $103,100, highlighting its strength as dynamic support. At the time of writing on Friday, it trades at around $104,500.
If BTC continues its correction and closes below the 50-day EMA at $103,100 on a daily basis, it could extend the decline to retest its key psychologically important level at $100,000.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum indicator on the daily chart reads 47, below its neutral level of 50, indicating that bearish momentum is gaining traction. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator displayed a bearish crossover last week. It also shows rising red histogram bars below its neutral level, indicating bearish momentum and giving credence to the downward trend.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.
Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 
Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

The adoption of cryptocurrency-related financial products, including tokenized treasuries, is on overdrive globally, with the focus now shifting to robust networks such as Ripple's XRP Ledger (XRPL).
Sei extends gains above $0.21, decoupling the token from the broader crypto market amid low sentiment and macroeconomic uncertainty. The Wyoming Stable Token Commission selects Sei Network as a candidate blockchain for the WYST, the first fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a US state.
Bitcoin bulls step up, pushing the price above $106,000, as Trump said he would delay his decision about launching strikes on Iran for up to two weeks. Ethereum rebounds from the 200-day EMA support at $2,477 amid steady interest in the derivatives market.
Solana experiences a minor uptick of under 1% at press time on Friday, with multiple long shadow candles forming above $140 as bearish momentum fades off. The optimism surrounding Solana is on the rise, as evidenced by the SOL Open Interest reaching a weekly high.
Bitcoin (BTC) price remains steady above a key support level, trading slightly above $106,000 at the time of writing on Friday. The uncertainty looms as geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel show no sign yet of an exit strategy from either side.

Here's something you don't see every day: Bitcoin's lesser-known cousins are stealing the show while the king of crypto takes a nap.
Bitcoin Cash has gone absolutely ballistic, rocketing 98% since its low point in April and trying to break the $500 resistance mark for good. Meanwhile, Bitcoin SV—yes, that controversial fork led by Satoshi pretender Craig Wright—is quietly climbing.
This rotation reflects broader market dynamics, with the S&P 500 on Friday hitting 6,000 points for the first time since February, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq approaches its own record near 20,000 as short-term traders appear to have priced in the panic over the current geopolitical events.
The Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates steady at 4.25%-4.5% on Wednesday has created a wait-and-see environment, with policymakers noting that ""uncertainty about the economic outlook has diminished, but remains elevated.""
Meanwhile, oil prices climbed over 4% on Tuesday as the Iran-Israel conflict raged, with Brent crude settling at $76.45—a development that traditionally correlates with crypto volatility, but has yet to significantly impact digital asset prices in the days since.
Bitcoin is putting investors to sleep with a 2% to $103,154 over the last week. The flagship cryptocurrency has entered a critical consolidation phase after failing to reclaim the $108,000-$109,000 resistance zone.
For traders watching the tape, this sideways grind often comes before the fireworks—for good or bad.
The weekly chart reveals a market in equilibrium, with several key indicators painting a nuanced picture:
RSI (Relative Strength Index): At 62 on the weekly time frame, Bitcoin shows mild bullish momentum without approaching overbought territory. The RSI measures the speed and magnitude of price changes: readings above 70 typically indicate overbought conditions where traders might expect a pullback, while below 30 suggests oversold levels that could precede a bounce. Bitcoin's current reading indicates healthy bullish momentum that could support further upside.
ADX (Average Directional Index): Reading 26, the ADX has just crossed the crucial 25 threshold, suggesting a trend is beginning to form in longer time frames. This indicator measures trend strength regardless of direction: below 20 indicates no trend, 20-25 shows a developing trend, and above 25 confirms trend establishment. For momentum traders, this crossing above 25 could signal the start of a more decisive move.
Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs): Bitcoin currently trades above its 50-week EMA (the average price of the last 50 weeks—basically one year), but faces resistance from the convergence of multiple time frames. The 50-200 EMA spread remains positive, which technical analysts often interpret as a bullish market structure. When shorter-term averages stay above longer-term ones, it typically indicates sustained buying pressure.
Squeeze Momentum Indicator: The ""off"" status on the weekly chart suggests volatility has already been released, contradicting the daily chart's compression. This divergence between time frames often precedes significant moves as different trader cohorts position themselves.
Key Levels:
Bitcoin Cash is the week's star performer with a commanding 14.57% surge to $483, briefly breaking past the psychologically significant $500 level—but it’s been unable to maintain momentum. BCH social media mentions surged as the price began to recover, pushing it to a new peak for 2025.
The weekly chart presents a compelling bullish case with room for continuation, with some cautions needed, of course:
RSI at 63: This reading places BCH in what traders often call the ""power zone"" —strong enough to indicate genuine momentum, but not yet extended enough to trigger profit-taking. Historical analysis shows BCH tends to run until RSI reaches 75-80, suggesting approximately 20% additional upside potential before overbought conditions emerge. That would match the resistance of the current triangle that has been in place since April.
ADX at 18: While below the 25 trend confirmation level, this reading shows that markets are fighting to push prices forward. However, this might not be a bad signal, and interpretation will vary as the indicator is analyzed alongside other readings. Low ADX readings after a strong move often indicate consolidation before the next leg higher. Traders might interpret this as the market digesting gains before attempting the next resistance level.
Moving Average Configuration: BCH trades decisively above both its 50-week and 200-week EMAs, with increasing separation between them. This expanding gap, known as moving average divergence, typically indicates strong trending conditions. The 50-week EMA near $385 now serves as dynamic support, while the 200-week mark at $352 provides a floor for any deeper corrections.
Key Levels:

BSV's 6% weekly gain to $31.47 since last Friday's low might look like small potatoes next to BCH's moonshot, but context is everything. The controversial fork is now trading 30% above its June lows despite persistent skepticism, finishing the week as the seventh-best performing cryptocurrency among the top 100. However, today's correction is giving signs of a flat performance if the week's shadows are not considered.
BSV's chart is like reading tea leaves, but here's what technical traders are seeing.
The RSI at 43 is slightly bearish but not terrible. Think of it as a car running on fumes, but not quite empty. Some contrarian traders love buying when RSI is this low, as they're betting on a bounce. History shows BSV often bottoms between 35-40, so we're in the danger zone where brave souls start nibbling.
Also, the ADX at 19 is yet another weak trend reading that creates a coiled spring scenario. When ADX readings remain below 20 for extended periods, the eventual breakout (in either direction) tends to be violent. Range traders might play the boundaries, while trend followers await confirmation above 25.
As for the price averages, BSV keeps failing to break past the 50-day average around $34.87, showing that bears are still pretty much in control of prices in longer time trends.

Bitcoin BTC$102,496.90 hovered near $104,700 during Asia hours, slipping 1.2% over 24 hours, while ether ETH$2,389.74 traded just below $2,860, down 1.8% on the day.
The soft price action tracks with broader macro unease following Wednesday’s FOMC hold, where the Fed kept rates unchanged but reiterated a cautious, inflation-sensitive stance.
Historically subdued during the June-July stretch, crypto markets have entered a lull with BTC front-end implied volumes slipping under 40%, erasing the risk premium from recent geopolitical tension, Singapore-based QCP Capital noted in a Thursday market broadcast.
Open interest across BTC and ETH perps remains flat, and option markets skew negative, with puts trading at a premium to calls – a sign of traders hedging against short-term pullbacks.
“There’s been no change to the technical picture, which remains supportive of another push to the topside,” said Joel Kruger, strategist at LMAX Group, in an email to CoinDesk. “BTC continues to consolidate bullishly, and a move through recent highs could set up a run toward $145,000.”
Ether still lags its 2021 highs but is gaining momentum, he added. “Clearing $2,900 could bring $3,400 into play,” Kruger said.
One bright spot for crypto is the U.S. Senate’s passage of a stablecoin framework, which adds another building block to what is becoming a more regulatory-friendly global environment. That’s reinforced a broader institutional conviction.
“Globally, we’re seeing continued progress that promises greater clarity and a more welcoming environment for institutional crypto adoption,” Kruger added.
Still, the near-term setup remains cautious. Month-end OPEX flows, systematic rebalancing, and a lack of fresh catalysts could keep BTC stuck in its $ 102,000–$ 108,000 band for now.
But with H2 historically strong for crypto, some desks are already looking ahead. “The worst may be behind us,” Kruger said. “And the next leg up could catch many off guard.”

Bitcoin and crypto prices have rocketed over the last year as traders bet on U.S. president Donald Trump’s administration boosting prices (helped by Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issuing a huge crypto market prediction).

The bitcoin price topped $100,000 late last year and has rebounded back above the psychological level after plunging along with stocks as a result of Trump’s so-called Liberation Day of global trade tariffs—with a fresh bitcoin price crash fear suddenly emerging.
Now, as Coinbase issues a serious bitcoin price warning, Trump has said the Senate passing a key piece of stablecoin legislation will lead to “massive” crypto investment.

U.S. president Donald Trump has predicted ""massive"" crypto investment as a result of the Genius Act ... More stablecoin bill—something many expect to boost the bitcoin price and crypto market.
“The Senate just passed an incredible bill that is going to make America the undisputed leader in digital assets,"" Trump posted to his Truth Social account, referring to the so-called Genius Act stablecoin bill and adding the U.S. is going to “show the world how to win” with bitcoin and crypto.
“Nobody will do it better, it is pure Genius! Digital assets are the future, and our nation is going to own it. We are talking about massive investment, and big innovation.”
The stablecoin market—dominated by Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC—has rocketed from almost zero 10 years ago to $250 billion today, with Wall Street, the world’s biggest retailers and Silicon Valley technology giants scrambling to grab a slice of the red-hot market.
This week, U.S. lawmakers in the Senate voted 68-30 to approve the bipartisan “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins,” known as the Genius Act, which would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, legitimizing their use for issuers and custodians.
Before the bill can be sent on to U.S. president Donald Trump’s desk for his signature, it must be voted through the House of Representatives.
House lawmakers can either vote on it as written or pursue changes that will require a final round in the Senate.
“The House will hopefully move lightening fast, and pass a 'clean’ Genius Act,” Trump said. “Get it to my desk, ASAP—no delays and no add ons.”

The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, helped by U.S. president Donald Trump's embrace of ... More bitcoin and crypto.
Meanwhile, Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks has echoed a crypto market prediction made by U.S. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, telling Bloomberg he expects the stablecoin bill will lead to the dollar-pegged stablecoin market surging 10-fold from $250 billion to trillions of dollars.
“The float is expected to grow from $250 billion to trillions of dollars,"" Sacks said, adding he expects “blockchain-based infrastructure will be used as a new kind of dollar-based payment system,” calling it the “payments system of the future.”
Attention is now shifting to the crypto market structure legislation known as the Clarity Act, which has been described by senator Cynthia Lummis as step two in the Trump administration’s three-step plan for crypto legislation, with step three getting the bitcoin strategic reserve signed into law.
The Genius Act’s passage through the Senate ""brings us one step closer to becoming a welcoming home for digital asset companies. Now, let’s finish the job and pass market structure legislation to fulfil [Trump's] vision of becoming the crypto capital of the world,"" Lummis posted to X.

Bitcoin (BTC) price edges slightly higher, trading near $104,700 at the time of writing on Thursday, after stabilizing above a key level, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $103,100. A breach below this level could trigger a sharp fall in BTC. The risk aversion could weigh in, as reports say US officials are preparing for a strike on Iran in the coming days. Despite this risk-off sentiment in global markets, institutional demand remained robust, with a positive inflow in US spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) for the last eight consecutive days.
The ongoing seven-day war between Iran and Israel took a major turn early on Thursday, as the news came in that the US officials are preparing for a strike on Iran in the coming days, according to Bloomberg. 

The chart below shows that the Asian markets reacted negatively to this news. However, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had a mild effect, as BTC holds around $104,700 during the early European session.

However, BTC traders should still remain cautious, as volatility could increase if the US attacks Iran in the upcoming days, which could further weigh on sentiment, potentially causing a sharp decline in the BTC price.
The US Federal Reserve (Fed) kept the interest rate unchanged at the 4.25%–4.50% range at its June meeting on Wednesday, as widely expected. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) still sees around 50 basis points of interest rate cuts through the end of 2025.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that ongoing policy uncertainty will keep the Fed in a rate-hold stance, and any rate cuts will be contingent on labor and inflation data.
The markets remained neutral, as an unchanged interest rate was highly expected. 
On Thursday, US President Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social account, “Too Late—Powell is the WORST. A real dummy, who’s costing America $Billions!”
Despite the fear and uncertainty regarding geopolitical conflicts, BTC shows some signs of optimism. Santiment's Bitcoin positive vs. negative commentary across social media data shows that Bitcoin sentiment from retail traders reaches 1.03 bullish comments for every 1 bearish comment, a level not seen since the Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) during the initial tariff reactions on April 6.  Historically, the markets have moved in opposite directions to retail sentiment, indicating early bullish signs for BTC.

Looking at the institutional demand also remains strong. According to SoSoValue data, US spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) recorded an inflow of $389.57 million on Wednesday, continuing its eight-day streak of gains since June 9. If these inflows continue, it could serve as a cushion for any price dips in BTC.

Bitcoin price drew liquidity from its Fair Value Gap (FVG) around $108,064 on Monday and declined by 2.1% the following day. BTC has retested and found support multiple times around the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at approximately $103,100, highlighting its strength as dynamic support. At the time of writing on Thursday, BTC trades at around $104,800.
If BTC continues its pullback and closes below the 50-day EMA at $103,100 on a daily basis, it could extend the decline to retest its key psychologically important level at $100,000.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum indicator on the daily chart reads 47, below its neutral level of 50, indicating that bearish momentum is gaining traction. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator displayed a bearish crossover last week. It also shows rising red histogram bars below its neutral level, indicating bearish momentum and giving credence to the downward trend.

On the contrary, if BTC closes above its FVG level at $108,064, it could extend the recovery toward retesting its May 22 all-time high of $111,980.
An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is an investment vehicle or an index that tracks the price of an underlying asset. ETFs can not only track a single asset, but a group of assets and sectors. For example, a Bitcoin ETF tracks Bitcoin’s price. ETF is a tool used by investors to gain exposure to a certain asset.
Yes. The first Bitcoin futures ETF in the US was approved by the US Securities & Exchange Commission in October 2021. A total of seven Bitcoin futures ETFs have been approved, with more than 20 still waiting for the regulator’s permission. The SEC says that the cryptocurrency industry is new and subject to manipulation, which is why it has been delaying crypto-related futures ETFs for the last few years.
Yes. The SEC approved in January 2024  the listing and trading of several Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Funds, opening the door to institutional capital and mainstream investors to trade the main crypto currency. The decision was hailed by the industry as a game changer.
The main advantage of crypto ETFs is the possibility of gaining exposure to a cryptocurrency without ownership, reducing the risk and cost of holding the asset. Other pros are a lower learning curve and higher security for investors since ETFs take charge of securing the underlying asset holdings. As for the main drawbacks, the main one is that as an investor you can’t have direct ownership of the asset, or, as they say in crypto, “not your keys, not your coins.” Other disadvantages are higher costs associated with holding crypto since ETFs charge fees for active management. Finally, even though investing in ETFs reduces the risk of holding an asset, price swings in the underlying cryptocurrency are likely to be reflected in the investment vehicle too.

Despite a surge in spot ETF inflows, stablecoin market caps, and positive regulatory developments in the U.S., the leading cryptocurrency by market value continues to trade directionless, fluctuating between $100,000 and $110,000.
It's been a record 42 straight days of back-and-forth trading above the $100K mark, and the question is: Who has been selling BTC and quietly counteracting the ETF inflows amid mounting concerns about the U.S. fiscal situation?
According to Alexander Blume, CEO at the SEC-registered investment adviser Two Prime, BTC is facing a unique crosswind of participant composition as it transitions from speculative buyers to long-term investors.
""Amidst the recent geopolitical turmoil, it makes sense that speculators and leverage traders are taking risk off the table. At the same time, new long-term investors are buying the dip,"" Blume told CoinDesk. ""It seems about right that we are currently at an equilibrium of these groups.""
Blockchain data tracked by Glassnode shows that wallets with a history of holding coins for less than a year have recently increased their profit-taking. On Monday, these wallets accounted for 83% of the total realized profit. Furthermore, wallets holding coins for six to 12 months alone contributed $904 million to the selling pressure in the market, the second-highest year-to-date total.
The selling by short-term holders follows an even more aggressive profit-taking operation by long-term holders in May and early this month. According to Glassnode, the realized profit of wallets holding coins for over 12 months reached a peak of $1.2 billion last week. Last week, this cohort realized just $324 million in profits.
""Long-term OG investors continue to sell into the steady ETF-driven demand, effectively absorbing inflows and keeping price action in check. This dynamic has led to a compression in volatility, but a breakout is inevitable,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a note to clients Thursday.
Miners, or those producing bitcoin, have also been contributing to the selling pressure, according to data source IntoTheBlock.
The balance held in miner wallets has declined to roughly 1.91 million BTC from 1.94 million at the end of May, indicating that these entities offloaded approximately 30,000 BTC in 20 days.
""Miners have to continually sell, and believe it or not, some long-term holders continue to sell gradually as they manage their USD liabilities. The key thing is volume - is it sold or bought on high volume? It is noise and speculative flows that can revert very quickly,"" Philippe Bekhazi, CEO of crypto platform XBTO, told CoinDesk.
Note that miners' share in total spot market volume is minuscule and has hit the lowest since 2022.
Overall, the substantial accumulation by both whales and small addresses observed during bitcoin's initial run higher from the early April lows near $75,000 has stalled since prices broke into six figures.
""Those same accumulation patterns began to weaken once BTC breached $100k. The reason the price slowed down is likely due to the availability of next-best alternatives. Funding rates were rallying hard, and having delta-neutral positions earning 15-30% APY likely seemed attractive enough to de-risk on a directional basis,"" Ben Lilly, co-founder of Jlabs Digital and Deploy.finance, noted.
The delta-neutral trades involve shorting perpetual futures and simultaneously purchasing the asset in the spot market when futures trade at a premium to the spot price. The non-directional arbitrage strategy enables traders to capitalize on price differentials while mitigating risks associated with price volatility.
Jimmy Yang, co-founder of Orbit Markets, said that bitcoin maturing into a more stable asset class means it may not necessarily generate outsized returns. That has likely prompted some holders to divest into other assets.
""While the directional upside remains, investors can no longer expect 10x or 100x returns in a short period. As a result, we’ve seen some long-term holders begin to divest a portion of their BTC holdings to diversify into other asset classes such as equities, gold, and private placements — a move that makes sense from a portfolio allocation perspective,"" Yang told CoinDesk.
According to Yang, the market may not offer much excitement in the near-term, as the cryptocurrency continues to trade in tandem with equities and broader risk sentiment.
""Both asset classes are hovering near all-time highs, and if equities break higher, BTC is likely to follow. With the summer lull setting in, market activity is expected to remain subdued in the near term,"" Yang noted.
Blume said that the BTC market may cool off a little, having seen prices surge from $75K to over $100K in the early weeks of this quarter.
""It’s also to keep in mind that Bitcoin rallied from 78k less than two months ago, so I’d expect a cool off anyway. It’s telling that the dips in price are quite shallow and are a sign of strength for the next leg up,"" Blume said.
According to Thielen, the key levels to watch are $102,000 on the downside and $106,000 on the upside.

Price action in the broader cryptocurrency market remains subdued following the Federal Reserve (Fed) decision on Wednesday, which met expectations leaving interest rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.50%. 
Bitcoin (BTC) has stalled below $105,000, signaling prolonged indecision, while Ethereum pares losses around $2,536, holding near critical support. Meanwhile, Ripple's (XRP) recovery remains elusive despite the approval of spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in Canada.
The Bitcoin futures contracts' Open Interest (OI) has maintained an overall downtrend after peaking at $80 billion on May 23, shortly after reaching all-time highs of $111,980. CoinGlass shows the OI, which represents the value of all active futures and options contracts that have yet to be closed or settled, standing at $69 billion on Thursday. 
A persistent downtrend in OI indicates a lack of conviction among traders and reduced trading activity. This has the potential to mitigate price increases, especially with liquidations remaining relatively high.

The newly launched CoinGlass Derivatives Risk Index (CDRI) indicator, which measures the intensity of the crypto derivatives market using OI, funding rates, volatility and liquidation volume, shows that the derivatives market is entering an unstable zone. In other words, both long and short positions are facing elevated risk.

Bitcoin spot ETFs attracted daily net inflows of $390 million on Wednesday, signaling interest in the asset as a store of value and a hedge against global market uncertainty amid tensions in the Middle East. BlackRock's IBIT led with a $279 million inflow, followed by Fidelity's FBTC with $104 million. Grayscale's GBTC was the only product in the red with outflows of $16 million.

Ethereum spot ETFs experienced their third consecutive day of steady inflows, with $19 million streaming in on Wednesday, compared to $11 million on Tuesday. BlackRock's ETHA led with $15 million in inflow volume, followed by Grayscale's ETHE with $4 million in inflow volume.

Bitcoin's price remains above a key support level, provided by the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), at approximately $103,146. Attempts to push to lower areas have left traders liquidated, with CoinGlass data showing $16 million wiped out on Thursday.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 48 offers signs of a potential reversal above the 50 midline as bullish momentum builds. 
Key areas of interest are the resistance at $107,000, which capped the BTC price in January and acted as resistance in May as well as $110,000, a psychological round number. On the contrary, beyond the 50-day EMA support, levels traders may want to monitor include the 100-day EMA at $98,991 and the 200-day EMA at $93,301.

Ethereum's price holds close to support provided by the 200-day EMA, currently at around $2,476 at the time of writing. Despite the widespread concerns about the conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Iran, recovery signs are still strong, with the RSI returning above the midline.
The path of least resistance could remain upward if the RSI sustains the uptrend. Key levels to watch out for include the recent range resistance at $2,876 and the coveted $3,000 round number. On the other hand, tentative support levels relevant to intraday traders are the 200-day EMA at $2,476, the 50-day EMA at $2,439 and the 100-day EMA at $2,372.
ETH/USDT & XRP/USDT daily charts
Meanwhile, XRP's price action remains limited below the confluence resistance established by the 50-day EMA and the 100-day EMA at around $2.24, as well as support highlighted by the 200-day EMA at $2.09.
The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator's sell signal sustained from Friday suggests a prolonged downtrend if traders reduce their exposure to XRP. Movement on either side of the confluence resistance and the support at $2.09 would determine the direction the price of XRP could take in upcoming sessions.
The lethargic performance exhibited by XRP suggests a lack of interest and conviction in the uptrend despite the Canadian securities regulator's approval of spot ETF products. Investors in the region now have access to 3iQ, Purpose and Evolve spot ETFs.
Higher Open Interest is associated with higher liquidity and new capital inflow to the market. This is considered the equivalent of increase in efficiency and the ongoing trend continues. When Open Interest decreases, it is considered a sign of liquidation in the market, investors are leaving and the overall demand for an asset is on a decline, fueling a bearish sentiment among investors.
Funding fees bridge the difference between spot prices and prices of futures contracts of an asset by increasing liquidation risks faced by traders. A consistently high and positive funding rate implies there is a bullish sentiment among market participants and there is an expectation of a price hike. A consistently negative funding rate for an asset implies a bearish sentiment, indicating that traders expect the cryptocurrency’s price to fall and a bearish trend reversal is likely to occur.

The adoption of cryptocurrency-related financial products, including tokenized treasuries, is on overdrive globally, with the focus now shifting to robust networks such as Ripple's XRP Ledger (XRPL).
Sei extends gains above $0.21, decoupling the token from the broader crypto market amid low sentiment and macroeconomic uncertainty. The Wyoming Stable Token Commission selects Sei Network as a candidate blockchain for the WYST, the first fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a US state.
Bitcoin bulls step up, pushing the price above $106,000, as Trump said he would delay his decision about launching strikes on Iran for up to two weeks. Ethereum rebounds from the 200-day EMA support at $2,477 amid steady interest in the derivatives market.
Solana experiences a minor uptick of under 1% at press time on Friday, with multiple long shadow candles forming above $140 as bearish momentum fades off. The optimism surrounding Solana is on the rise, as evidenced by the SOL Open Interest reaching a weekly high.
Bitcoin (BTC) price remains steady above a key support level, trading slightly above $106,000 at the time of writing on Friday. The uncertainty looms as geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel show no sign yet of an exit strategy from either side.

Bitcoin and crypto prices have rocketed over the last year as traders bet on U.S. president Donald Trump’s administration boosting prices (helped by Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issuing a huge crypto market prediction).

The bitcoin price topped $100,000 late last year and has rebounded back above the psychological level after plunging along with stocks as a result of Trump’s so-called Liberation Day of global trade tariffs—with a fresh bitcoin price crash fear suddenly emerging.
Now, as Coinbase issues a serious bitcoin price warning, Trump has said the Senate passing a key piece of stablecoin legislation will lead to “massive” crypto investment.

U.S. president Donald Trump has predicted ""massive"" crypto investment as a result of the Genius Act ... More stablecoin bill—something many expect to boost the bitcoin price and crypto market.
“The Senate just passed an incredible bill that is going to make America the undisputed leader in digital assets,"" Trump posted to his Truth Social account, referring to the so-called Genius Act stablecoin bill and adding the U.S. is going to “show the world how to win” with bitcoin and crypto.
“Nobody will do it better, it is pure Genius! Digital assets are the future, and our nation is going to own it. We are talking about massive investment, and big innovation.”
The stablecoin market—dominated by Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC—has rocketed from almost zero 10 years ago to $250 billion today, with Wall Street, the world’s biggest retailers and Silicon Valley technology giants scrambling to grab a slice of the red-hot market.
This week, U.S. lawmakers in the Senate voted 68-30 to approve the bipartisan “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins,” known as the Genius Act, which would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, legitimizing their use for issuers and custodians.
Before the bill can be sent on to U.S. president Donald Trump’s desk for his signature, it must be voted through the House of Representatives.
House lawmakers can either vote on it as written or pursue changes that will require a final round in the Senate.
“The House will hopefully move lightening fast, and pass a 'clean’ Genius Act,” Trump said. “Get it to my desk, ASAP—no delays and no add ons.”

The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, helped by U.S. president Donald Trump's embrace of ... More bitcoin and crypto.
Meanwhile, Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks has echoed a crypto market prediction made by U.S. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, telling Bloomberg he expects the stablecoin bill will lead to the dollar-pegged stablecoin market surging 10-fold from $250 billion to trillions of dollars.
“The float is expected to grow from $250 billion to trillions of dollars,"" Sacks said, adding he expects “blockchain-based infrastructure will be used as a new kind of dollar-based payment system,” calling it the “payments system of the future.”
Attention is now shifting to the crypto market structure legislation known as the Clarity Act, which has been described by senator Cynthia Lummis as step two in the Trump administration’s three-step plan for crypto legislation, with step three getting the bitcoin strategic reserve signed into law.
The Genius Act’s passage through the Senate ""brings us one step closer to becoming a welcoming home for digital asset companies. Now, let’s finish the job and pass market structure legislation to fulfil [Trump's] vision of becoming the crypto capital of the world,"" Lummis posted to X.

Bitcoin (BTC) price edges slightly higher, trading near $104,700 at the time of writing on Thursday, after stabilizing above a key level, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $103,100. A breach below this level could trigger a sharp fall in BTC. The risk aversion could weigh in, as reports say US officials are preparing for a strike on Iran in the coming days. Despite this risk-off sentiment in global markets, institutional demand remained robust, with a positive inflow in US spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) for the last eight consecutive days.
The ongoing seven-day war between Iran and Israel took a major turn early on Thursday, as the news came in that the US officials are preparing for a strike on Iran in the coming days, according to Bloomberg. 

The chart below shows that the Asian markets reacted negatively to this news. However, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had a mild effect, as BTC holds around $104,700 during the early European session. 
Asian markets chart.
However, BTC traders should still remain cautious, as volatility could increase if the US attacks Iran in the upcoming days, which could further weigh on sentiment, potentially causing a sharp decline in the BTC price.
The US Federal Reserve (Fed) kept the interest rate unchanged at the 4.25%–4.50% range at its June meeting on Wednesday, as widely expected. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) still sees around 50 basis points of interest rate cuts through the end of 2025.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that ongoing policy uncertainty will keep the Fed in a rate-hold stance, and any rate cuts will be contingent on labor and inflation data.
The markets remained neutral, as an unchanged interest rate was highly expected. 
On Thursday, US President Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social account, “Too Late—Powell is the WORST. A real dummy, who’s costing America $Billions!”
Despite the fear and uncertainty regarding geopolitical conflicts, BTC shows some signs of optimism. Santiment's Bitcoin positive vs. negative commentary across social media data shows that Bitcoin sentiment from retail traders reaches 1.03 bullish comments for every 1 bearish comment, a level not seen since the Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) during the initial tariff reactions on April 6.  Historically, the markets have moved in opposite directions to retail sentiment, indicating early bullish signs for BTC.

Looking at the institutional demand also remains strong. According to SoSoValue data, US spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) recorded an inflow of $389.57 million on Wednesday, continuing its eight-day streak of gains since June 9. If these inflows continue, it could serve as a cushion for any price dips in BTC.

Bitcoin price drew liquidity from its Fair Value Gap (FVG) around $108,064 on Monday and declined by 2.1% the following day. BTC has retested and found support multiple times around the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at approximately $103,100, highlighting its strength as dynamic support. At the time of writing on Thursday, BTC trades at around $104,800.
If BTC continues its pullback and closes below the 50-day EMA at $103,100 on a daily basis, it could extend the decline to retest its key psychologically important level at $100,000.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum indicator on the daily chart reads 47, below its neutral level of 50, indicating that bearish momentum is gaining traction. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator displayed a bearish crossover last week. It also shows rising red histogram bars below its neutral level, indicating bearish momentum and giving credence to the downward trend.

On the contrary, if BTC closes above its FVG level at $108,064, it could extend the recovery toward retesting its May 22 all-time high of $111,980.
An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is an investment vehicle or an index that tracks the price of an underlying asset. ETFs can not only track a single asset, but a group of assets and sectors. For example, a Bitcoin ETF tracks Bitcoin’s price. ETF is a tool used by investors to gain exposure to a certain asset.
Yes. The first Bitcoin futures ETF in the US was approved by the US Securities & Exchange Commission in October 2021. A total of seven Bitcoin futures ETFs have been approved, with more than 20 still waiting for the regulator’s permission. The SEC says that the cryptocurrency industry is new and subject to manipulation, which is why it has been delaying crypto-related futures ETFs for the last few years.
Yes. The SEC approved in January 2024  the listing and trading of several Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Funds, opening the door to institutional capital and mainstream investors to trade the main crypto currency. The decision was hailed by the industry as a game changer.
The main advantage of crypto ETFs is the possibility of gaining exposure to a cryptocurrency without ownership, reducing the risk and cost of holding the asset. Other pros are a lower learning curve and higher security for investors since ETFs take charge of securing the underlying asset holdings. As for the main drawbacks, the main one is that as an investor you can’t have direct ownership of the asset, or, as they say in crypto, “not your keys, not your coins.” Other disadvantages are higher costs associated with holding crypto since ETFs charge fees for active management. Finally, even though investing in ETFs reduces the risk of holding an asset, price swings in the underlying cryptocurrency are likely to be reflected in the investment vehicle too.

Despite a surge in spot ETF inflows, stablecoin market caps, and positive regulatory developments in the U.S., the leading cryptocurrency by market value continues to trade directionless, fluctuating between $100,000 and $110,000.
It's been a record 42 straight days of back-and-forth trading above the $100K mark, and the question is: Who has been selling BTC and quietly counteracting the ETF inflows amid mounting concerns about the U.S. fiscal situation?
According to Alexander Blume, CEO at the SEC-registered investment adviser Two Prime, BTC is facing a unique crosswind of participant composition as it transitions from speculative buyers to long-term investors.
""Amidst the recent geopolitical turmoil, it makes sense that speculators and leverage traders are taking risk off the table. At the same time, new long-term investors are buying the dip,"" Blume told CoinDesk. ""It seems about right that we are currently at an equilibrium of these groups.""
Blockchain data tracked by Glassnode shows that wallets with a history of holding coins for less than a year have recently increased their profit-taking. On Monday, these wallets accounted for 83% of the total realized profit. Furthermore, wallets holding coins for six to 12 months alone contributed $904 million to the selling pressure in the market, the second-highest year-to-date total.
The selling by short-term holders follows an even more aggressive profit-taking operation by long-term holders in May and early this month. According to Glassnode, the realized profit of wallets holding coins for over 12 months reached a peak of $1.2 billion last week. Last week, this cohort realized just $324 million in profits.
""Long-term OG investors continue to sell into the steady ETF-driven demand, effectively absorbing inflows and keeping price action in check. This dynamic has led to a compression in volatility, but a breakout is inevitable,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a note to clients Thursday.
Miners, or those producing bitcoin, have also been contributing to the selling pressure, according to data source IntoTheBlock.
The balance held in miner wallets has declined to roughly 1.91 million BTC from 1.94 million at the end of May, indicating that these entities offloaded approximately 30,000 BTC in 20 days.
""Miners have to continually sell, and believe it or not, some long-term holders continue to sell gradually as they manage their USD liabilities. The key thing is volume - is it sold or bought on high volume? It is noise and speculative flows that can revert very quickly,"" Philippe Bekhazi, CEO of crypto platform XBTO, told CoinDesk.
Note that miners' share in total spot market volume is minuscule and has hit the lowest since 2022.
Overall, the substantial accumulation by both whales and small addresses observed during bitcoin's initial run higher from the early April lows near $75,000 has stalled since prices broke into six figures.
""Those same accumulation patterns began to weaken once BTC breached $100k. The reason the price slowed down is likely due to the availability of next-best alternatives. Funding rates were rallying hard, and having delta-neutral positions earning 15-30% APY likely seemed attractive enough to de-risk on a directional basis,"" Ben Lilly, co-founder of Jlabs Digital and Deploy.finance, noted.
The delta-neutral trades involve shorting perpetual futures and simultaneously purchasing the asset in the spot market when futures trade at a premium to the spot price. The non-directional arbitrage strategy enables traders to capitalize on price differentials while mitigating risks associated with price volatility.
Jimmy Yang, co-founder of Orbit Markets, said that bitcoin maturing into a more stable asset class means it may not necessarily generate outsized returns. That has likely prompted some holders to divest into other assets.
""While the directional upside remains, investors can no longer expect 10x or 100x returns in a short period. As a result, we’ve seen some long-term holders begin to divest a portion of their BTC holdings to diversify into other asset classes such as equities, gold, and private placements — a move that makes sense from a portfolio allocation perspective,"" Yang told CoinDesk.
According to Yang, the market may not offer much excitement in the near-term, as the cryptocurrency continues to trade in tandem with equities and broader risk sentiment.
""Both asset classes are hovering near all-time highs, and if equities break higher, BTC is likely to follow. With the summer lull setting in, market activity is expected to remain subdued in the near term,"" Yang noted.
Blume said that the BTC market may cool off a little, having seen prices surge from $75K to over $100K in the early weeks of this quarter.
""It’s also to keep in mind that Bitcoin rallied from 78k less than two months ago, so I’d expect a cool off anyway. It’s telling that the dips in price are quite shallow and are a sign of strength for the next leg up,"" Blume said.
According to Thielen, the key levels to watch are $102,000 on the downside and $106,000 on the upside.

Price action in the broader cryptocurrency market remains subdued following the Federal Reserve (Fed) decision on Wednesday, which met expectations leaving interest rates unchanged in the range of 4.25% to 4.50%. 
Bitcoin (BTC) has stalled below $105,000, signaling prolonged indecision, while Ethereum pares losses around $2,536, holding near critical support. Meanwhile, Ripple's (XRP) recovery remains elusive despite the approval of spot Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in Canada.
The Bitcoin futures contracts' Open Interest (OI) has maintained an overall downtrend after peaking at $80 billion on May 23, shortly after reaching all-time highs of $111,980. CoinGlass shows the OI, which represents the value of all active futures and options contracts that have yet to be closed or settled, standing at $69 billion on Thursday. 
A persistent downtrend in OI indicates a lack of conviction among traders and reduced trading activity. This has the potential to mitigate price increases, especially with liquidations remaining relatively high.

The newly launched CoinGlass Derivatives Risk Index (CDRI) indicator, which measures the intensity of the crypto derivatives market using OI, funding rates, volatility and liquidation volume, shows that the derivatives market is entering an unstable zone. In other words, both long and short positions are facing elevated risk.

Bitcoin spot ETFs attracted daily net inflows of $390 million on Wednesday, signaling interest in the asset as a store of value and a hedge against global market uncertainty amid tensions in the Middle East. BlackRock's IBIT led with a $279 million inflow, followed by Fidelity's FBTC with $104 million. Grayscale's GBTC was the only product in the red with outflows of $16 million.

Ethereum spot ETFs experienced their third consecutive day of steady inflows, with $19 million streaming in on Wednesday, compared to $11 million on Tuesday. BlackRock's ETHA led with $15 million in inflow volume, followed by Grayscale's ETHE with $4 million in inflow volume.

Bitcoin's price remains above a key support level, provided by the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), at approximately $103,146. Attempts to push to lower areas have left traders liquidated, with CoinGlass data showing $16 million wiped out on Thursday.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 48 offers signs of a potential reversal above the 50 midline as bullish momentum builds. 
Key areas of interest are the resistance at $107,000, which capped the BTC price in January and acted as resistance in May as well as $110,000, a psychological round number. On the contrary, beyond the 50-day EMA support, levels traders may want to monitor include the 100-day EMA at $98,991 and the 200-day EMA at $93,301.
BTC/USDT daily chart
Ethereum's price holds close to support provided by the 200-day EMA, currently at around $2,476 at the time of writing. Despite the widespread concerns about the conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Iran, recovery signs are still strong, with the RSI returning above the midline.
The path of least resistance could remain upward if the RSI sustains the uptrend. Key levels to watch out for include the recent range resistance at $2,876 and the coveted $3,000 round number. On the other hand, tentative support levels relevant to intraday traders are the 200-day EMA at $2,476, the 50-day EMA at $2,439 and the 100-day EMA at $2,372.
ETH/USDT & XRP/USDT daily charts
Meanwhile, XRP's price action remains limited below the confluence resistance established by the 50-day EMA and the 100-day EMA at around $2.24, as well as support highlighted by the 200-day EMA at $2.09.
The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator's sell signal sustained from Friday suggests a prolonged downtrend if traders reduce their exposure to XRP. Movement on either side of the confluence resistance and the support at $2.09 would determine the direction the price of XRP could take in upcoming sessions.
The lethargic performance exhibited by XRP suggests a lack of interest and conviction in the uptrend despite the Canadian securities regulator's approval of spot ETF products. Investors in the region now have access to 3iQ, Purpose and Evolve spot ETFs.
Higher Open Interest is associated with higher liquidity and new capital inflow to the market. This is considered the equivalent of increase in efficiency and the ongoing trend continues. When Open Interest decreases, it is considered a sign of liquidation in the market, investors are leaving and the overall demand for an asset is on a decline, fueling a bearish sentiment among investors.
Funding fees bridge the difference between spot prices and prices of futures contracts of an asset by increasing liquidation risks faced by traders. A consistently high and positive funding rate implies there is a bullish sentiment among market participants and there is an expectation of a price hike. A consistently negative funding rate for an asset implies a bearish sentiment, indicating that traders expect the cryptocurrency’s price to fall and a bearish trend reversal is likely to occur.

Bitcoin and crypto prices have rocketed over the last year as traders bet on U.S. president Donald Trump’s administration boosting prices (helped by Treasury secretary Scott Bessent issuing a huge crypto market prediction).

The bitcoin price topped $100,000 late last year and has rebounded back above the psychological level after plunging along with stocks as a result of Trump’s so-called Liberation Day of global trade tariffs—with a fresh bitcoin price crash fear suddenly emerging.
Now, as Coinbase issues a serious bitcoin price warning, Trump has said the Senate passing a key piece of stablecoin legislation will lead to “massive” crypto investment.

U.S. president Donald Trump has predicted ""massive"" crypto investment as a result of the Genius Act ... More stablecoin bill—something many expect to boost the bitcoin price and crypto market.
“The Senate just passed an incredible bill that is going to make America the undisputed leader in digital assets,"" Trump posted to his Truth Social account, referring to the so-called Genius Act stablecoin bill and adding the U.S. is going to “show the world how to win” with bitcoin and crypto.
“Nobody will do it better, it is pure Genius! Digital assets are the future, and our nation is going to own it. We are talking about massive investment, and big innovation.”
The stablecoin market—dominated by Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC—has rocketed from almost zero 10 years ago to $250 billion today, with Wall Street, the world’s biggest retailers and Silicon Valley technology giants scrambling to grab a slice of the red-hot market.
This week, U.S. lawmakers in the Senate voted 68-30 to approve the bipartisan “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins,” known as the Genius Act, which would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, legitimizing their use for issuers and custodians.
Before the bill can be sent on to U.S. president Donald Trump’s desk for his signature, it must be voted through the House of Representatives.
House lawmakers can either vote on it as written or pursue changes that will require a final round in the Senate.
“The House will hopefully move lightening fast, and pass a 'clean’ Genius Act,” Trump said. “Get it to my desk, ASAP—no delays and no add ons.”

The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, helped by U.S. president Donald Trump's embrace of ... More bitcoin and crypto.
Meanwhile, Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks has echoed a crypto market prediction made by U.S. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, telling Bloomberg he expects the stablecoin bill will lead to the dollar-pegged stablecoin market surging 10-fold from $250 billion to trillions of dollars.
“The float is expected to grow from $250 billion to trillions of dollars,"" Sacks said, adding he expects “blockchain-based infrastructure will be used as a new kind of dollar-based payment system,” calling it the “payments system of the future.”
Attention is now shifting to the crypto market structure legislation known as the Clarity Act, which has been described by senator Cynthia Lummis as step two in the Trump administration’s three-step plan for crypto legislation, with step three getting the bitcoin strategic reserve signed into law.

Bitcoin (BTC) price edges slightly higher, trading near $104,700 at the time of writing on Thursday, after stabilizing above a key level, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $103,100. A breach below this level could trigger a sharp fall in BTC. The risk aversion could weigh in, as reports say US officials are preparing for a strike on Iran in the coming days. Despite this risk-off sentiment in global markets, institutional demand remained robust, with a positive inflow in US spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) for the last eight consecutive days.
The ongoing seven-day war between Iran and Israel took a major turn early on Thursday, as the news came in that the US officials are preparing for a strike on Iran in the coming days, according to Bloomberg. 

The chart below shows that the Asian markets reacted negatively to this news. However, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had a mild effect, as BTC holds around $104,700 during the early European session.

However, BTC traders should still remain cautious, as volatility could increase if the US attacks Iran in the upcoming days, which could further weigh on sentiment, potentially causing a sharp decline in the BTC price.
The US Federal Reserve (Fed) kept the interest rate unchanged at the 4.25%–4.50% range at its June meeting on Wednesday, as widely expected. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) still sees around 50 basis points of interest rate cuts through the end of 2025.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that ongoing policy uncertainty will keep the Fed in a rate-hold stance, and any rate cuts will be contingent on labor and inflation data.
The markets remained neutral, as an unchanged interest rate was highly expected. 
On Thursday, US President Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social account, “Too Late—Powell is the WORST. A real dummy, who’s costing America $Billions!”
Despite the fear and uncertainty regarding geopolitical conflicts, BTC shows some signs of optimism. Santiment's Bitcoin positive vs. negative commentary across social media data shows that Bitcoin sentiment from retail traders reaches 1.03 bullish comments for every 1 bearish comment, a level not seen since the Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) during the initial tariff reactions on April 6.  Historically, the markets have moved in opposite directions to retail sentiment, indicating early bullish signs for BTC.

Looking at the institutional demand also remains strong. According to SoSoValue data, US spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) recorded an inflow of $389.57 million on Wednesday, continuing its eight-day streak of gains since June 9. If these inflows continue, it could serve as a cushion for any price dips in BTC.

Bitcoin price drew liquidity from its Fair Value Gap (FVG) around $108,064 on Monday and declined by 2.1% the following day. BTC has retested and found support multiple times around the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at approximately $103,100, highlighting its strength as dynamic support. At the time of writing on Thursday, BTC trades at around $104,800.
If BTC continues its pullback and closes below the 50-day EMA at $103,100 on a daily basis, it could extend the decline to retest its key psychologically important level at $100,000.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum indicator on the daily chart reads 47, below its neutral level of 50, indicating that bearish momentum is gaining traction. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator displayed a bearish crossover last week. It also shows rising red histogram bars below its neutral level, indicating bearish momentum and giving credence to the downward trend.

On the contrary, if BTC closes above its FVG level at $108,064, it could extend the recovery toward retesting its May 22 all-time high of $111,980.
An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is an investment vehicle or an index that tracks the price of an underlying asset. ETFs can not only track a single asset, but a group of assets and sectors. For example, a Bitcoin ETF tracks Bitcoin’s price. ETF is a tool used by investors to gain exposure to a certain asset.
Yes. The first Bitcoin futures ETF in the US was approved by the US Securities & Exchange Commission in October 2021. A total of seven Bitcoin futures ETFs have been approved, with more than 20 still waiting for the regulator’s permission. The SEC says that the cryptocurrency industry is new and subject to manipulation, which is why it has been delaying crypto-related futures ETFs for the last few years.
Yes. The SEC approved in January 2024  the listing and trading of several Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Funds, opening the door to institutional capital and mainstream investors to trade the main crypto currency. The decision was hailed by the industry as a game changer.
The main advantage of crypto ETFs is the possibility of gaining exposure to a cryptocurrency without ownership, reducing the risk and cost of holding the asset. Other pros are a lower learning curve and higher security for investors since ETFs take charge of securing the underlying asset holdings. As for the main drawbacks, the main one is that as an investor you can’t have direct ownership of the asset, or, as they say in crypto, “not your keys, not your coins.” Other disadvantages are higher costs associated with holding crypto since ETFs charge fees for active management. Finally, even though investing in ETFs reduces the risk of holding an asset, price swings in the underlying cryptocurrency are likely to be reflected in the investment vehicle too.

The adoption of cryptocurrency-related financial products, including tokenized treasuries, is on overdrive globally, with the focus now shifting to robust networks such as Ripple's XRP Ledger (XRPL).
Sei extends gains above $0.21, decoupling the token from the broader crypto market amid low sentiment and macroeconomic uncertainty. The Wyoming Stable Token Commission selects Sei Network as a candidate blockchain for the WYST, the first fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a US state.
Bitcoin bulls step up, pushing the price above $106,000, as Trump said he would delay his decision about launching strikes on Iran for up to two weeks. Ethereum rebounds from the 200-day EMA support at $2,477 amid steady interest in the derivatives market.
Solana experiences a minor uptick of under 1% at press time on Friday, with multiple long shadow candles forming above $140 as bearish momentum fades off. The optimism surrounding Solana is on the rise, as evidenced by the SOL Open Interest reaching a weekly high.
Bitcoin (BTC) price remains steady above a key support level, trading slightly above $106,000 at the time of writing on Friday. The uncertainty looms as geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel show no sign yet of an exit strategy from either side.

Despite a surge in spot ETF inflows, stablecoin market caps, and positive regulatory developments in the U.S., the leading cryptocurrency by market value continues to trade directionless, fluctuating between $100,000 and $110,000.
It's been a record 42 straight days of back-and-forth trading above the $100K mark, and the question is: Who has been selling BTC and quietly counteracting the ETF inflows amid mounting concerns about the U.S. fiscal situation?
According to Alexander Blume, CEO at the SEC-registered investment adviser Two Prime, BTC is facing a unique crosswind of participant composition as it transitions from speculative buyers to long-term investors.
""Amidst the recent geopolitical turmoil, it makes sense that speculators and leverage traders are taking risk off the table. At the same time, new long-term investors are buying the dip,"" Blume told CoinDesk. ""It seems about right that we are currently at an equilibrium of these groups.""
Blockchain data tracked by Glassnode shows that wallets with a history of holding coins for less than a year have recently increased their profit-taking. On Monday, these wallets accounted for 83% of the total realized profit. Furthermore, wallets holding coins for six to 12 months alone contributed $904 million to the selling pressure in the market, the second-highest year-to-date total.
The selling by short-term holders follows an even more aggressive profit-taking operation by long-term holders in May and early this month. According to Glassnode, the realized profit of wallets holding coins for over 12 months reached a peak of $1.2 billion last week. Last week, this cohort realized just $324 million in profits.
""Long-term OG investors continue to sell into the steady ETF-driven demand, effectively absorbing inflows and keeping price action in check. This dynamic has led to a compression in volatility, but a breakout is inevitable,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a note to clients Thursday.
Miners, or those producing bitcoin, have also been contributing to the selling pressure, according to data source IntoTheBlock.
The balance held in miner wallets has declined to roughly 1.91 million BTC from 1.94 million at the end of May, indicating that these entities offloaded approximately 30,000 BTC in 20 days.
""Miners have to continually sell, and believe it or not, some long-term holders continue to sell gradually as they manage their USD liabilities. The key thing is volume - is it sold or bought on high volume? It is noise and speculative flows that can revert very quickly,"" Philippe Bekhazi, CEO of crypto platform XBTO, told CoinDesk.
Note that miners' share in total spot market volume is minuscule and has hit the lowest since 2022.
Overall, the substantial accumulation by both whales and small addresses observed during bitcoin's initial run higher from the early April lows near $75,000 has stalled since prices broke into six figures.
""Those same accumulation patterns began to weaken once BTC breached $100k. The reason the price slowed down is likely due to the availability of next-best alternatives. Funding rates were rallying hard, and having delta-neutral positions earning 15-30% APY likely seemed attractive enough to de-risk on a directional basis,"" Ben Lilly, co-founder of Jlabs Digital and Deploy.finance, noted.
The delta-neutral trades involve shorting perpetual futures and simultaneously purchasing the asset in the spot market when futures trade at a premium to the spot price. The non-directional arbitrage strategy enables traders to capitalize on price differentials while mitigating risks associated with price volatility.
Jimmy Yang, co-founder of Orbit Markets, said that bitcoin maturing into a more stable asset class means it may not necessarily generate outsized returns. That has likely prompted some holders to divest into other assets.
""While the directional upside remains, investors can no longer expect 10x or 100x returns in a short period. As a result, we’ve seen some long-term holders begin to divest a portion of their BTC holdings to diversify into other asset classes such as equities, gold, and private placements — a move that makes sense from a portfolio allocation perspective,"" Yang told CoinDesk.
According to Yang, the market may not offer much excitement in the near-term, as the cryptocurrency continues to trade in tandem with equities and broader risk sentiment.
""Both asset classes are hovering near all-time highs, and if equities break higher, BTC is likely to follow. With the summer lull setting in, market activity is expected to remain subdued in the near term,"" Yang noted.
Blume said that the BTC market may cool off a little, having seen prices surge from $75K to over $100K in the early weeks of this quarter.
""It’s also to keep in mind that Bitcoin rallied from 78k less than two months ago, so I’d expect a cool off anyway. It’s telling that the dips in price are quite shallow and are a sign of strength for the next leg up,"" Blume said.
According to Thielen, the key levels to watch are $102,000 on the downside and $106,000 on the upside.

The crypto market finds itself at a crossroads as geopolitical tensions rattle global financial markets. The crypto majors have barely budged today, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and all the rest down the line staying flat—for crypto standards anyway,
Total cryptocurrency market capitalization sits at $3.58 trillion, right around where it was yesterday. Bitcoin is struggling to hold above the $104,000 mark, again, right around where it was yesterday. XRP is trading for $2.14, and Ethereum is just above $2,500—both in the green, but only barely.
In the macro picture, the Israel-Iran conflict has sent oil prices surging 7%, with Brent crude touching $78, while traditional safe havens like gold see renewed interest. The S&P 500 hovers just below 6,000 points, reflecting broader market uncertainty as investors juggle inflation concerns, Federal Reserve policy decisions, and escalating Middle East tensions.
But there’s at least two coins making big moves today: one to the moon, the other into the earth.
Fartcoin has become a bit of a favored token among meme coin traders. For one, because it’s funny and memes trade on vibes. But for another, the Solana-based token had been on a seemingly unstoppable journey upwards as “hot air rises.” Today, though, the vibes are down.
Fartcoin's 9.7% tumble today exemplifies the volatile nature of meme coin trading. The Binance.US listing helped spark the euphoria among degens, driving volume up 66% to $373 million, but reality quickly set in as profit-takers emerged. This ""sell the news"" pattern is a textbook reaction that experienced traders often anticipate.
The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, for Fartcoin sits at 42, nearing oversold territory—this metric measures momentum by comparing recent gains to losses, with readings below 50 suggesting bearish pressure is building. When RSI drops below 50, it often signals that sellers are gaining control, making short-term rebounds less likely.
The token’s Average Directional Index, or ADX, reads 16, indicating that the previous long-term bullish trend is losing its strength and is now weak. ADX measures how strong a price trend is regardless of direction—readings below 25 suggest the market lacks conviction, meaning traders should expect choppy, directionless action rather than sustained moves.
The Exponential Moving Averages for Fartcoin paint a bearish picture: the token is trading below the 50-day EMA ($1.21) and approaching the 200-day EMA ($1.02). When price falls below these key moving averages, it typically indicates that the short-term trend has turned negative, and traders often use these levels as dynamic resistance points to sell rallies. However, the short-term EMA is well over the long term EMA, which is still a good sign for long-term traders as a death cross (when the EMA 50 is below the EMA 200, meaning the average price of the coin a long time ago was much higher than buying it at recent prices) is not yet looking like a strong possibility.
Key Levels:
But if Fartcoin is making degens cry of financial pain, OKB's impressive 13.5% surge is making its holders cry out of pure joy. Crypto exchange OKX’s token climbed all the way up to $54.70 before a minor correction to its current price of $52.87—still enough for a 9.87% price jump on the day.
OKX's 28th token burn removed 42.4 million OKB from circulation, representing 20% of the circulating supply—a move that typically creates immediate scarcity and drives prices higher as remaining tokens become more valuable.
OKB's RSI reading at 55.26 actually shows neutral-to-bullish momentum rather than oversold conditions. This suggests OKB has already recovered from oversold levels and is now in healthier territory above 50, which typically indicates bullish momentum when combined with price above key EMAs. However, this was likely an event-based move, so traders will want to wait and see if the trend continues after everyone sold the news.
The ADX at 17 shows the previous downtrend is losing steam. Combined with the oversold bounce, this suggests a potential trend reversal is underway, though experienced traders with an eye for technicals will wait for ADX to rise above 25 to confirm a new uptrend is established.
Price action shows OKB reclaiming the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at $52.81—these levels act as natural support and resistance based on mathematical ratios traders widely monitor. Breaking above this level with volume suggests buyers are regaining control. It also broke past the EMA 50, which confirms this thesis.
As always, though, it’s impossible to say with certainty whether the move is just a reaction to big news or a natural correction that will maintain momentum over time.

Cryptocurrency
markets faced significant headwinds today (Wednesday), June 18, 2025, with
major digital assets including Bitcoin (BTC) experiencing widespread declines
amid mounting geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty. 
The total
cryptocurrency market capitalization dropped 1.6% to $3.28 trillion as
investors retreated from risk assets following escalating Middle East tensions
and policy uncertainty.
In this
article, we answer the question of why crypto is going down today, why Dogecoin
is falling for the fifth consecutive session, and what the outlook is for the
digital asset market.
Bitcoin
demonstrated relative stability compared to altcoins, declining 1.4% to trade
at $104,737. The world's largest cryptocurrency has managed to hold above the
psychologically important $100,000 level despite facing pressure from multiple
fronts. Over the past week, Bitcoin has declined in six of seven trading
sessions, reflecting broader market caution.
The
cryptocurrency's price action has been influenced by President Trump's recent
comments regarding Iran's supreme leader, which he described as an “easy
target,” sparking fresh geopolitical concerns. Bitcoin briefly dipped from
$104,310 to $103,553 following these remarks before recovering.
Technical
analysis suggests Bitcoin  
            Bitcoin
           
      While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we’ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC’s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John’s.One could now argue that

    Read this Term faces critical support at the $102,000 level.
Bitfinex analysts noted that “Bitcoin is still at risk of falling further,
and it must hold above $102,000 to stay on track for a potential rebound.”
Long-term holders remain relatively inactive, indicating no widespread
profit-taking despite recent volatility.
“Mirroring
the risk off mindset prevalent across markets, cryptocurrency prices were no
exception overnight. Geo-political issues around the Middle-East and threat of
escalation in one of the major oil producing regions has sent oil and bond
prices higher and risk assets like equities and crypto lower. We can expect to
see some consolidation until the political situation in the Middle-East calms
down and investors once again swing away from bonds,” Paul Howard, Director at Wincent, commented for FinanceMagnates.com.
Ethereum (ETH)
experienced a sharper decline, falling 1.6% to $2,525. The second-largest
cryptocurrency by market capitalization has struggled to maintain momentum
above the $2,500 support level. Earlier in the session, Ethereum dropped as
much as 8% before paring losses.
The
cryptocurrency's performance reflects broader altcoin weakness, with technical
indicators showing continued downward pressure. Ethereum's decline comes
despite positive developments in the broader ecosystem, including continued
institutional interest and regulatory clarity around stablecoins.
Market
observers point to Ethereum's correlation with risk assets as a key factor in
its recent underperformance. The token has been particularly sensitive to
macroeconomic developments and geopolitical tensions.
Ethereum
must defend the $2,500 level to prevent further deterioration, while XRP faces
resistance at $2.20 with potential downside targets around $2.10.
XRP
suffered one of the steepest declines among major cryptocurrencies, falling
over 3% to $2.15. The Ripple-associated token has now declined nearly 9% for
the week, facing resistance at the $2.20 level.
High-volume
selling pressure dominated XRP trading, with the sharpest declines occurring
during peak trading hours. Technical analysis reveals a descending channel
pattern, suggesting continued bearish momentum unless buyers can reclaim key
resistance levels.
The token's
weakness comes despite ongoing developments in Ripple's ecosystem, including
the upcoming RLUSD stablecoin deployment and regulatory progress in Dubai and
Singapore markets.
Dogecoin
(DOGE) continued its downward trajectory, falling 1.5% to $0.17, marking the
fifth consecutive day of declines. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency has been
particularly vulnerable to the current risk-off sentiment, dropping from $0.176
to $0.164 during the session's most intense selling period.
The
cryptocurrency found support at the $0.164 level, forming what some analysts
view as a potential double bottom pattern. However, trading volume has declined
sharply as the market awaits clearer directional signals.
“What’s telling is the pressure on second-tier altcoins.
Look at the daily candles and monthly performance: XRP and SOL are down more
than 6%, while DOGE, SUI, ADA, and AVAX have dropped over 15%. This divergence
suggests a market that’s becoming more selective favoring large-cap resilience
while shedding riskier assets,” said Dr. Kirill Kretov from Coinpanel.
“That said, we have to remember: crypto market liquidity is still extremely
thin,” he added. “Volatility remains tightly managed by larger players who continue to
extract profits by hunting unhedged or leveraged participants. The current
environment rewards caution and punishes overexposure especially outside the
majors.”
The primary
catalyst for the current market weakness stems from escalating tensions between
Israel and Iran. Rising oil prices and concerns about potential U.S.
involvement have prompted investors to reduce exposure to risk assets,
including cryptocurrencies.
Over $230
million in long cryptocurrency positions were liquidated in the past 12 hours,
according to Coinglass data. This forced selling has amplified downward
pressure across the market.
Adding to
the cryptocurrency market's woes, Iran's largest digital asset exchange Nobitex
suffered a devastating cyberattack that drained approximately $82 million from
its wallets on June 18, 2025. The Israeli-linked hacking group “Gonjeshke
Darande” (Predatory Sparrow) claimed responsibility for the breach, moving
stolen funds through provocatively named wallet addresses containing
anti-Iranian messaging across multiple blockchain networks including Tron,
Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum-compatible chains.
Despite
near-term headwinds, the U.S. Senate's passage of the GENIUS Act represents a
significant milestone for the cryptocurrency industry. The bipartisan
legislation establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins backed by
Treasury bills and high-quality liquid assets.
Despite
current weakness, several factors support potential recovery scenarios. The
cryptocurrency market has historically demonstrated resilience following
geopolitical shocks, and institutional adoption continues to grow.

near-term volatility is likely to persist as markets navigate ongoing

near-term headwinds, the U.S. Senate's passage of the GENIUS Act represents a
significant milestone for the cryptocurrency industry. The bipartisan
legislation establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins backed by
Treasury bills and high-quality liquid assets.
Despite
current weakness, several factors support potential recovery scenarios. The
cryptocurrency market has historically demonstrated resilience following
geopolitical shocks, and institutional adoption continues to grow.

    Read this Term legislation could accelerate mainstream adoption by enabling
traditional companies to incorporate cryptocurrency payment systems. This
regulatory clarity represents a structural positive for the industry's
long-term prospects.
However,
near-term volatility is likely to persist as markets navigate ongoing
geopolitical tensions and central bank policy decisions. The Federal Reserve's
upcoming policy meeting and continued Middle East developments will be key
catalysts for market direction.

There is an old saying, ""Once is a chance, twice is a coincidence, and a third time is a trend.""
It applies to bitcoin BTC$103,135.92 right now. The cryptocurrency's price has fallen back to its 50-day simple moving average (SMA), which offered support on two occasions this month, leading to price bounces.
Therefore, the latest re-test of the average presents an opportunity for the bulls to establish a trend in which the 50-day SMA powers new legs higher. Conversely, the fall of the 50-day SMA support could invite stronger selling pressure, potentially leading to a dip below $100,000.
At press time, the bear case appears strong due to signs of bull fatigue, as evident from the recent shallow bounces from the 50-day SMA. The first test of the average on June 5 produced a bounce from roughly $100,500 to over $10,000. However, the second test of the SMA on June 17 saw prices bounce only from $103,000 to $109,000.
The past week's Doji candle also suggests bull fatigue above $100,000.
A high-volume move above $110,000 is needed to restore the immediate bullish outlook.
Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP XRP$2.10 is trading at the lower end of the Ichimoku cloud, a momentum indicator based on several moving average variants and developed by a Japanese journalist in the 1960s.
Crossovers above and below the cloud are said to represent bullish and bearish shifts in momentum.
When an asset's price crosses below the cloud, as dogecoin DOGE$0.15924 did early this month, it typically signals a bearish trend. Traders often interpret this as a signal to consider selling or shorting the asset, especially if other macro or technical indicators confirm the signal.
XRP's 50-day SMA has already crossed below the 200-day SMA to confirm the so-called death cross, a bearish indicator. Therefore, a potential move below the Ichimoku cloud could prove costly for the bears, potentially opening the door for a slide below $2.
On the charts, support is seen directly at $ 1.60, the early April low. Coins like DOGE, ADA, and LINK have dropped below their respective Ichimoku clouds in recent days, resulting in price losses.

Geopolitical heat in the Middle East is melting crypto prices. 
Bitcoin has fallen 3% to about $105,000 since the conflict between Israel and Iran started on June 13, according to CoinGecko. Ethereum plunged 8% to around $2,500 and nearly $200 billion was erased from the crypto market in the past six days. 
Markets are reeling after US President Donald Trump hinted that the US could soon intervene in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Just last week, Israel launched a series of airstrikes in retaliation for attacks by Iran-backed militants.
“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding,” Trump posted on social media, referring to Iranian head of state Ali Khamenei. “Our patience is wearing thin.”
That political brinkmanship has sent tremors through capital markets. US stocks slipped, oil prices jumped, and gold plunged. 
Risk assets like stocks and crypto tend to fall — at least initially — when war breaks out because investors flee uncertainty. Armed conflict rattles global supply chains, can destabilise economies, and trigger inflation, especially if oil prices spike. Iran produces about 3.3 million barrels of oil daily, which is about 4% of global production. 
And in crypto, the impact of Trump’s latest warning was immediate and severe. Coinbase stock fell 4%, Strategy about 3%, and Circle — which went public last week, offering up a triple-digit jackpot for investors — plunged nearly 3%. They have since slightly recovered.
Odds of a US military strike on Iran before August soared to 70% on Polymarket.
To be sure, the longer term implications of a global conflict on Bitcoin’s price remain unclear. In fact, the top crypto tends to rebound after geopolitical shocks. 
In 2022, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, both Bitcoin and gold underperformed. According to Bitcoin analyst James Check, Bitcoin plunged 40% while gold lost 5% in the first year following Russia’s attack. 
“I should note that the US Federal Reserve was aggressively raising interest rates, and most markets were in a bear market,” Check wrote in his Monday newsletter, Checkonchain. 
Following Hamas’s October 7 attacks against Israel in 2023, gold and Bitcoin spiked. The precious metal appreciated 38% while Bitcoin gained 70%. 
“The Bitcoin ETFs launched a few months after the conflict, and gold was experiencing a major bid from global central banks,” said Check. 
For Check, there might be more at play than rising tensions in the Middle East. 
Still, eyes are on the skies in Tehran and Tel Aviv.

Bitcoin price has retreated in the past few days, and the futures market points to more downside, potentially to $100,000.
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to $104,650 on Wednesday, June 18, marking a 6.52% decline from its highest level this year. Option traders are increasingly betting on further declines. Data from Deribit shows that the put-to-call volume ratio rose to 2.17, indicating that more traders are buying put options as a hedge.
A put option gives investors the right, but not the obligation, to sell an asset at a specific price within a defined time period. In this case, for contracts expiring on Friday, open interest in put options is concentrated at the $100,000 strike.
Investors remain cautious amid the escalating crisis in the Middle East. In a statement on Tuesday, Donald Trump suggested the U.S. may enter the conflict and potentially target Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
The conflict could fuel inflation in the U.S. and globally. Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude prices rose to $76 and $74, respectively, while global shipping costs have also jumped. As a result, the Federal Open Market Committee may opt for a wait-and-see approach, monitoring the impact of geopolitical tensions and Trump’s proposed tariffs.
On a more positive note, Bitcoin demand appears to be rising. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw over $216 million in inflows on Tuesday, bringing total cumulative inflows to $46.26 billion. In a note, an XBTO analyst said:
“A hawkish signal from the Federal Reserve could strengthen the US dollar and trigger a test of the psychological $100,000 mark. The geopolitical situation remains a wildcard, where further deterioration would likely trigger another move down across risk assets.”
On the eight-hour chart, BTC has pulled back from a high of $110,500 to around $104,530. It has formed a double-top pattern with a neckline at $100,300, a formation often associated with bearish breakouts.
Bitcoin has also fallen below the 50-period Exponential Moving Average and is approaching the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. Meanwhile, the MACD indicator has dropped below the zero line.
As such, Bitcoin may continue falling, with the next level to watch being $100,300, about 4.2% below current prices. A break below that support could open the door to a deeper decline toward the 38.2% retracement level at $97,560.

Bitcoin (BTC) hovers around $105,000 at the time of writing on Wednesday, following a 2% drop the previous day. Traders' are waiting for the US Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate decision due later in the day, which could bring volatility to risky assets, such as BTC. Meanwhile, the risk sentiment stabilizes despite US President Donald Trump considering options for US military action against Iran.
Bitcoin investors' attention shifts to the Fed’s interest rate decision on late Wednesday.
Dhwani Mehta, Senior Analyst at FXStreet, reports that the Fed is likely to keep the federal funds rate steady in the range of 4.25%-4.50%, reiterating its prudence in the policy outlook.
The analyst further explains that the central bank’s quarterly projections on growth, inflation and potential rate cuts by year-end, will hold the key to altering markets’ expectations of rate cuts this year. Markets wait for the Fed to continue to predict two 25-basis-points (bps) rate reductions in the second half of this year, setting to resume its rate-cutting cycle from September, according to the CME FedWatch tool.
If the bank's statement on Wednesday sounds more cautious or signals a dovish stance, it may lower interest rates. This could be a bullish case for riskier assets, such as BTC, as lower rates could increase the purchasing power of investors and prompt them to shift toward riskier assets. However, if the Fed has a hawkish stance, it could have a bearish effect on the BTC price.
Bitcoin price dipped on Tuesday, reaching a low of $103,371, amid escalating tensions in the Middle East. 
The six-day-old war between Iran and Israel that started last week took a new turn on Tuesday as US President Donald Trump said on social media that the US knew the location of the country’s leader but was choosing not to take any action and then added, “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!”, reports Wall Street Journal. 
Moreover, Israeli Channel 12 media outlet reportedly said on Tuesday that the US could join the war against Iran that same night. 
So far, the US has not taken any military action against Iran, hinting at some sign of relief for investors.
However, traders should still remain cautious, as any further escalation of ongoing tensions could disrupt stability in global risk markets. 
Despite the war uncertainty, there are some signs of optimism for Bitcoin. The US Senate passed the GENIUS bill on Tuesday and now awaits final deliberation in the House before it can move on to the President's desk. 
The US Senate’s decision on a stablecoin regulatory bill marks a milestone for the crypto industry. This decision has a positive outlook, as it helps establish a legal framework for stablecoins, which could enhance their legitimacy and facilitate wider adoption. Additionally, this could also boost the stablecoin market capitalization, which is considered the gateway to crypto and has a positive correlation with Bitcoin price.
According to SoSoValue data, US spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) recorded an inflow of $216.48 million on Tuesday, continuing its seven-day streak of gains since June 9.

Bitcoin price declined sharply, falling from the June 10 close of $110,274 to the June 11 close of $105,671, creating a Fair Value Gap (FVG) at approximately $108,064. This bearish FVG marks a key resistance zone, meaning that once Bitcoin collects liquidity, it is likely to continue its correction.
On Monday, BTC retested and faced a slight pullback from this FGV zone, closing the day up by 1.14%. However, it declined by 2.10% the next day and retested its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) around $103,070. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it hovers at around $105,000.
If BTC continues its correction and closes below the 50-day EMA at $103,070 on a daily basis, it could extend the decline to retest its key psychologically important level at $100,000.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum indicator on the daily chart has slipped slightly below its neutral level of 50, indicating increasing bearish momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator on the daily chart displayed a bearish crossover last week. It also shows rising red histogram bars below its neutral level, indicating bearish momentum and giving credence to the downward trend.

On the contrary, if BTC closes above its FVG level at $108,064, it could extend the recovery toward retesting its May 22 all-time high of $111,980.
Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.
Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 
Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Cryptocurrency
markets faced significant headwinds today (Wednesday), June 18, 2025, with
major digital assets including Bitcoin (BTC) experiencing widespread declines
amid mounting geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty. 
The total
cryptocurrency market capitalization dropped 1.6% to $3.28 trillion as
investors retreated from risk assets following escalating Middle East tensions
and policy uncertainty.
In this
article, we answer the question of why crypto is going down today, why Dogecoin
is falling for the fifth consecutive session, and what the outlook is for the
digital asset market.
Bitcoin
demonstrated relative stability compared to altcoins, declining 1.4% to trade
at $104,737. The world's largest cryptocurrency has managed to hold above the
psychologically important $100,000 level despite facing pressure from multiple
fronts. Over the past week, Bitcoin has declined in six of seven trading
sessions, reflecting broader market caution.
The
cryptocurrency's price action has been influenced by President Trump's recent
comments regarding Iran's supreme leader, which he described as an “easy
target,” sparking fresh geopolitical concerns. Bitcoin briefly dipped from
$104,310 to $103,553 following these remarks before recovering.
Technical
analysis suggests Bitcoin  
            Bitcoin
           
      While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we’ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC’s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John’s.One could now argue that

    Read this Term faces critical support at the $102,000 level.
Bitfinex analysts noted that “Bitcoin is still at risk of falling further,
and it must hold above $102,000 to stay on track for a potential rebound.”
Long-term holders remain relatively inactive, indicating no widespread
profit-taking despite recent volatility.
“Mirroring
the risk off mindset prevalent across markets, cryptocurrency prices were no
exception overnight. Geo-political issues around the Middle-East and threat of
escalation in one of the major oil producing regions has sent oil and bond
prices higher and risk assets like equities and crypto lower. We can expect to
see some consolidation until the political situation in the Middle-East calms
down and investors once again swing away from bonds,” Paul Howard, Director at Wincent, commented for FinanceMagnates.com.
Ethereum (ETH)
experienced a sharper decline, falling 1.6% to $2,525. The second-largest
cryptocurrency by market capitalization has struggled to maintain momentum
above the $2,500 support level. Earlier in the session, Ethereum dropped as
much as 8% before paring losses.
The
cryptocurrency's performance reflects broader altcoin weakness, with technical
indicators showing continued downward pressure. Ethereum's decline comes
despite positive developments in the broader ecosystem, including continued
institutional interest and regulatory clarity around stablecoins.
Market
observers point to Ethereum's correlation with risk assets as a key factor in
its recent underperformance. The token has been particularly sensitive to
macroeconomic developments and geopolitical tensions.
Ethereum
must defend the $2,500 level to prevent further deterioration, while XRP faces
resistance at $2.20 with potential downside targets around $2.10.
XRP
suffered one of the steepest declines among major cryptocurrencies, falling
over 3% to $2.15. The Ripple-associated token has now declined nearly 9% for
the week, facing resistance at the $2.20 level.
High-volume
selling pressure dominated XRP trading, with the sharpest declines occurring
during peak trading hours. Technical analysis reveals a descending channel
pattern, suggesting continued bearish momentum unless buyers can reclaim key
resistance levels.
The token's
weakness comes despite ongoing developments in Ripple's ecosystem, including
the upcoming RLUSD stablecoin deployment and regulatory progress in Dubai and
Singapore markets.
Dogecoin
(DOGE) continued its downward trajectory, falling 1.5% to $0.17, marking the
fifth consecutive day of declines. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency has been
particularly vulnerable to the current risk-off sentiment, dropping from $0.176
to $0.164 during the session's most intense selling period.
The
cryptocurrency found support at the $0.164 level, forming what some analysts
view as a potential double bottom pattern. However, trading volume has declined
sharply as the market awaits clearer directional signals.
“What’s telling is the pressure on second-tier altcoins.
Look at the daily candles and monthly performance: XRP and SOL are down more
than 6%, while DOGE, SUI, ADA, and AVAX have dropped over 15%. This divergence
suggests a market that’s becoming more selective favoring large-cap resilience
while shedding riskier assets,” said Dr. Kirill Kretov from Coinpanel.
“That said, we have to remember: crypto market liquidity is still extremely
thin,” he added. “Volatility remains tightly managed by larger players who continue to
extract profits by hunting unhedged or leveraged participants. The current
environment rewards caution and punishes overexposure especially outside the
majors.”
The primary
catalyst for the current market weakness stems from escalating tensions between
Israel and Iran. Rising oil prices and concerns about potential U.S.
involvement have prompted investors to reduce exposure to risk assets,
including cryptocurrencies.
Over $230
million in long cryptocurrency positions were liquidated in the past 12 hours,
according to Coinglass data. This forced selling has amplified downward
pressure across the market.
Adding to
the cryptocurrency market's woes, Iran's largest digital asset exchange Nobitex
suffered a devastating cyberattack that drained approximately $82 million from
its wallets on June 18, 2025. The Israeli-linked hacking group “Gonjeshke
Darande” (Predatory Sparrow) claimed responsibility for the breach, moving
stolen funds through provocatively named wallet addresses containing
anti-Iranian messaging across multiple blockchain networks including Tron,
Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum-compatible chains.
Despite
near-term headwinds, the U.S. Senate's passage of the GENIUS Act represents a
significant milestone for the cryptocurrency industry. The bipartisan
legislation establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins backed by
Treasury bills and high-quality liquid assets.
Despite
current weakness, several factors support potential recovery scenarios. The
cryptocurrency market has historically demonstrated resilience following
geopolitical shocks, and institutional adoption continues to grow.

There is an old saying, ""Once is a chance, twice is a coincidence, and a third time is a trend.""
It applies to bitcoin BTC$103,059.65 right now. The cryptocurrency's price has fallen back to its 50-day simple moving average (SMA), which offered support on two occasions this month, leading to price bounces.
Therefore, the latest re-test of the average presents an opportunity for the bulls to establish a trend in which the 50-day SMA powers new legs higher. Conversely, the fall of the 50-day SMA support could invite stronger selling pressure, potentially leading to a dip below $100,000.
At press time, the bear case appears strong due to signs of bull fatigue, as evident from the recent shallow bounces from the 50-day SMA. The first test of the average on June 5 produced a bounce from roughly $100,500 to over $10,000. However, the second test of the SMA on June 17 saw prices bounce only from $103,000 to $109,000.
The past week's Doji candle also suggests bull fatigue above $100,000.
A high-volume move above $110,000 is needed to restore the immediate bullish outlook.
Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP XRP$2.10 is trading at the lower end of the Ichimoku cloud, a momentum indicator based on several moving average variants and developed by a Japanese journalist in the 1960s.
Crossovers above and below the cloud are said to represent bullish and bearish shifts in momentum.
When an asset's price crosses below the cloud, as dogecoin DOGE$0.15901 did early this month, it typically signals a bearish trend. Traders often interpret this as a signal to consider selling or shorting the asset, especially if other macro or technical indicators confirm the signal.
XRP's 50-day SMA has already crossed below the 200-day SMA to confirm the so-called death cross, a bearish indicator. Therefore, a potential move below the Ichimoku cloud could prove costly for the bears, potentially opening the door for a slide below $2.
On the charts, support is seen directly at $ 1.60, the early April low. Coins like DOGE, ADA, and LINK have dropped below their respective Ichimoku clouds in recent days, resulting in price losses.

Geopolitical heat in the Middle East is melting crypto prices. 
Bitcoin has fallen 3% to about $105,000 since the conflict between Israel and Iran started on June 13, according to CoinGecko. Ethereum plunged 8% to around $2,500 and nearly $200 billion was erased from the crypto market in the past six days. 
Markets are reeling after US President Donald Trump hinted that the US could soon intervene in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Just last week, Israel launched a series of airstrikes in retaliation for attacks by Iran-backed militants.
“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding,” Trump posted on social media, referring to Iranian head of state Ali Khamenei. “Our patience is wearing thin.”
That political brinkmanship has sent tremors through capital markets. US stocks slipped, oil prices jumped, and gold plunged. 
Risk assets like stocks and crypto tend to fall — at least initially — when war breaks out because investors flee uncertainty. Armed conflict rattles global supply chains, can destabilise economies, and trigger inflation, especially if oil prices spike. Iran produces about 3.3 million barrels of oil daily, which is about 4% of global production. 
And in crypto, the impact of Trump’s latest warning was immediate and severe. Coinbase stock fell 4%, Strategy about 3%, and Circle — which went public last week, offering up a triple-digit jackpot for investors — plunged nearly 3%. They have since slightly recovered.
Odds of a US military strike on Iran before August soared to 70% on Polymarket.
To be sure, the longer term implications of a global conflict on Bitcoin’s price remain unclear. In fact, the top crypto tends to rebound after geopolitical shocks. 
In 2022, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, both Bitcoin and gold underperformed. According to Bitcoin analyst James Check, Bitcoin plunged 40% while gold lost 5% in the first year following Russia’s attack. 
“I should note that the US Federal Reserve was aggressively raising interest rates, and most markets were in a bear market,” Check wrote in his Monday newsletter, Checkonchain. 
Following Hamas’s October 7 attacks against Israel in 2023, gold and Bitcoin spiked. The precious metal appreciated 38% while Bitcoin gained 70%. 
“The Bitcoin ETFs launched a few months after the conflict, and gold was experiencing a major bid from global central banks,” said Check. 
For Check, there might be more at play than rising tensions in the Middle East. 
Still, eyes are on the skies in Tehran and Tel Aviv.

Bitcoin price has retreated in the past few days, and the futures market points to more downside, potentially to $100,000.
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to $104,650 on Wednesday, June 18, marking a 6.52% decline from its highest level this year. Option traders are increasingly betting on further declines. Data from Deribit shows that the put-to-call volume ratio rose to 2.17, indicating that more traders are buying put options as a hedge.
A put option gives investors the right, but not the obligation, to sell an asset at a specific price within a defined time period. In this case, for contracts expiring on Friday, open interest in put options is concentrated at the $100,000 strike.
Investors remain cautious amid the escalating crisis in the Middle East. In a statement on Tuesday, Donald Trump suggested the U.S. may enter the conflict and potentially target Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
The conflict could fuel inflation in the U.S. and globally. Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude prices rose to $76 and $74, respectively, while global shipping costs have also jumped. As a result, the Federal Open Market Committee may opt for a wait-and-see approach, monitoring the impact of geopolitical tensions and Trump’s proposed tariffs.
On a more positive note, Bitcoin demand appears to be rising. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw over $216 million in inflows on Tuesday, bringing total cumulative inflows to $46.26 billion. In a note, an XBTO analyst said:
“A hawkish signal from the Federal Reserve could strengthen the US dollar and trigger a test of the psychological $100,000 mark. The geopolitical situation remains a wildcard, where further deterioration would likely trigger another move down across risk assets.”
On the eight-hour chart, BTC has pulled back from a high of $110,500 to around $104,530. It has formed a double-top pattern with a neckline at $100,300, a formation often associated with bearish breakouts.
Bitcoin has also fallen below the 50-period Exponential Moving Average and is approaching the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. Meanwhile, the MACD indicator has dropped below the zero line.
As such, Bitcoin may continue falling, with the next level to watch being $100,300, about 4.2% below current prices. A break below that support could open the door to a deeper decline toward the 38.2% retracement level at $97,560.

Bitcoin (BTC) hovers around $105,000 at the time of writing on Wednesday, following a 2% drop the previous day. Traders' are waiting for the US Federal Reserve (Fed) interest rate decision due later in the day, which could bring volatility to risky assets, such as BTC. Meanwhile, the risk sentiment stabilizes despite US President Donald Trump considering options for US military action against Iran.
Bitcoin investors' attention shifts to the Fed’s interest rate decision on late Wednesday.
Dhwani Mehta, Senior Analyst at FXStreet, reports that the Fed is likely to keep the federal funds rate steady in the range of 4.25%-4.50%, reiterating its prudence in the policy outlook.
The analyst further explains that the central bank’s quarterly projections on growth, inflation and potential rate cuts by year-end, will hold the key to altering markets’ expectations of rate cuts this year. Markets wait for the Fed to continue to predict two 25-basis-points (bps) rate reductions in the second half of this year, setting to resume its rate-cutting cycle from September, according to the CME FedWatch tool.
If the bank's statement on Wednesday sounds more cautious or signals a dovish stance, it may lower interest rates. This could be a bullish case for riskier assets, such as BTC, as lower rates could increase the purchasing power of investors and prompt them to shift toward riskier assets. However, if the Fed has a hawkish stance, it could have a bearish effect on the BTC price.
Bitcoin price dipped on Tuesday, reaching a low of $103,371, amid escalating tensions in the Middle East. 
The six-day-old war between Iran and Israel that started last week took a new turn on Tuesday as US President Donald Trump said on social media that the US knew the location of the country’s leader but was choosing not to take any action and then added, “UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!”, reports Wall Street Journal. 
Moreover, Israeli Channel 12 media outlet reportedly said on Tuesday that the US could join the war against Iran that same night. 
So far, the US has not taken any military action against Iran, hinting at some sign of relief for investors.
However, traders should still remain cautious, as any further escalation of ongoing tensions could disrupt stability in global risk markets. 
Despite the war uncertainty, there are some signs of optimism for Bitcoin. The US Senate passed the GENIUS bill on Tuesday and now awaits final deliberation in the House before it can move on to the President's desk. 
The US Senate’s decision on a stablecoin regulatory bill marks a milestone for the crypto industry. This decision has a positive outlook, as it helps establish a legal framework for stablecoins, which could enhance their legitimacy and facilitate wider adoption. Additionally, this could also boost the stablecoin market capitalization, which is considered the gateway to crypto and has a positive correlation with Bitcoin price.
According to SoSoValue data, US spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) recorded an inflow of $216.48 million on Tuesday, continuing its seven-day streak of gains since June 9.

Bitcoin price declined sharply, falling from the June 10 close of $110,274 to the June 11 close of $105,671, creating a Fair Value Gap (FVG) at approximately $108,064. This bearish FVG marks a key resistance zone, meaning that once Bitcoin collects liquidity, it is likely to continue its correction.
On Monday, BTC retested and faced a slight pullback from this FGV zone, closing the day up by 1.14%. However, it declined by 2.10% the next day and retested its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) around $103,070. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it hovers at around $105,000.
If BTC continues its correction and closes below the 50-day EMA at $103,070 on a daily basis, it could extend the decline to retest its key psychologically important level at $100,000.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum indicator on the daily chart has slipped slightly below its neutral level of 50, indicating increasing bearish momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator on the daily chart displayed a bearish crossover last week. It also shows rising red histogram bars below its neutral level, indicating bearish momentum and giving credence to the downward trend.

On the contrary, if BTC closes above its FVG level at $108,064, it could extend the recovery toward retesting its May 22 all-time high of $111,980.
Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.
Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 
Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

The adoption of cryptocurrency-related financial products, including tokenized treasuries, is on overdrive globally, with the focus now shifting to robust networks such as Ripple's XRP Ledger (XRPL).
Sei extends gains above $0.21, decoupling the token from the broader crypto market amid low sentiment and macroeconomic uncertainty. The Wyoming Stable Token Commission selects Sei Network as a candidate blockchain for the WYST, the first fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a US state.
Bitcoin bulls step up, pushing the price above $106,000, as Trump said he would delay his decision about launching strikes on Iran for up to two weeks. Ethereum rebounds from the 200-day EMA support at $2,477 amid steady interest in the derivatives market.
Solana experiences a minor uptick of under 1% at press time on Friday, with multiple long shadow candles forming above $140 as bearish momentum fades off. The optimism surrounding Solana is on the rise, as evidenced by the SOL Open Interest reaching a weekly high.
Bitcoin (BTC) price remains steady above a key support level, trading slightly above $106,000 at the time of writing on Friday. The uncertainty looms as geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel show no sign yet of an exit strategy from either side.

Cryptocurrency
markets faced significant headwinds today (Wednesday), June 18, 2025, with
major digital assets including Bitcoin (BTC) experiencing widespread declines
amid mounting geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty. 
The total
cryptocurrency market capitalization dropped 1.6% to $3.28 trillion as
investors retreated from risk assets following escalating Middle East tensions
and policy uncertainty.
In this
article, we answer the question of why crypto is going down today, why Dogecoin
is falling for the fifth consecutive session, and what the outlook is for the
digital asset market.
Bitcoin
demonstrated relative stability compared to altcoins, declining 1.4% to trade
at $104,737. The world's largest cryptocurrency has managed to hold above the
psychologically important $100,000 level despite facing pressure from multiple
fronts. Over the past week, Bitcoin has declined in six of seven trading
sessions, reflecting broader market caution.
The
cryptocurrency's price action has been influenced by President Trump's recent
comments regarding Iran's supreme leader, which he described as an “easy
target,” sparking fresh geopolitical concerns. Bitcoin briefly dipped from
$104,310 to $103,553 following these remarks before recovering.
Technical
analysis suggests Bitcoin  
            Bitcoin
           
      While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we’ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC’s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John’s.One could now argue that 
     
    While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we’ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz made BTC’s first official commercial transaction with a real company by trading 10,000 Bitcoins for 2 pizzas at his local Papa John’s.One could now argue that 
    Read this Term faces critical support at the $102,000 level.
Bitfinex analysts noted that “Bitcoin is still at risk of falling further,
and it must hold above $102,000 to stay on track for a potential rebound.”
Long-term holders remain relatively inactive, indicating no widespread
profit-taking despite recent volatility.
“Mirroring
the risk off mindset prevalent across markets, cryptocurrency prices were no
exception overnight. Geo-political issues around the Middle-East and threat of
escalation in one of the major oil producing regions has sent oil and bond
prices higher and risk assets like equities and crypto lower. We can expect to
see some consolidation until the political situation in the Middle-East calms
down and investors once again swing away from bonds,” Paul Howard, Director at Wincent, commented for FinanceMagnates.com.
Ethereum (ETH)
experienced a sharper decline, falling 1.6% to $2,525. The second-largest
cryptocurrency by market capitalization has struggled to maintain momentum
above the $2,500 support level. Earlier in the session, Ethereum dropped as
much as 8% before paring losses.
The
cryptocurrency's performance reflects broader altcoin weakness, with technical
indicators showing continued downward pressure. Ethereum's decline comes
despite positive developments in the broader ecosystem, including continued
institutional interest and regulatory clarity around stablecoins.
Market
observers point to Ethereum's correlation with risk assets as a key factor in
its recent underperformance. The token has been particularly sensitive to
macroeconomic developments and geopolitical tensions.
Ethereum
must defend the $2,500 level to prevent further deterioration, while XRP faces
resistance at $2.20 with potential downside targets around $2.10.
XRP
suffered one of the steepest declines among major cryptocurrencies, falling
over 3% to $2.15. The Ripple-associated token has now declined nearly 9% for
the week, facing resistance at the $2.20 level.
High-volume
selling pressure dominated XRP trading, with the sharpest declines occurring
during peak trading hours. Technical analysis reveals a descending channel
pattern, suggesting continued bearish momentum unless buyers can reclaim key
resistance levels.
The token's
weakness comes despite ongoing developments in Ripple's ecosystem, including
the upcoming RLUSD stablecoin deployment and regulatory progress in Dubai and
Singapore markets.
Dogecoin
(DOGE) continued its downward trajectory, falling 1.5% to $0.17, marking the
fifth consecutive day of declines. The meme-inspired cryptocurrency has been
particularly vulnerable to the current risk-off sentiment, dropping from $0.176
to $0.164 during the session's most intense selling period.
The
cryptocurrency found support at the $0.164 level, forming what some analysts
view as a potential double bottom pattern. However, trading volume has declined
sharply as the market awaits clearer directional signals.
“What’s telling is the pressure on second-tier altcoins.
Look at the daily candles and monthly performance: XRP and SOL are down more
than 6%, while DOGE, SUI, ADA, and AVAX have dropped over 15%. This divergence
suggests a market that’s becoming more selective favoring large-cap resilience
while shedding riskier assets,” said Dr. Kirill Kretov from Coinpanel.
“That said, we have to remember: crypto market liquidity is still extremely
thin,” he added. “Volatility remains tightly managed by larger players who continue to
extract profits by hunting unhedged or leveraged participants. The current
environment rewards caution and punishes overexposure especially outside the
majors.”
The primary
catalyst for the current market weakness stems from escalating tensions between
Israel and Iran. Rising oil prices and concerns about potential U.S.
involvement have prompted investors to reduce exposure to risk assets,
including cryptocurrencies.
Over $230
million in long cryptocurrency positions were liquidated in the past 12 hours,
according to Coinglass data. This forced selling has amplified downward
pressure across the market.
Adding to
the cryptocurrency market's woes, Iran's largest digital asset exchange Nobitex
suffered a devastating cyberattack that drained approximately $82 million from
its wallets on June 18, 2025. The Israeli-linked hacking group “Gonjeshke
Darande” (Predatory Sparrow) claimed responsibility for the breach, moving
stolen funds through provocatively named wallet addresses containing
anti-Iranian messaging across multiple blockchain networks including Tron,
Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum-compatible chains.
Despite
near-term headwinds, the U.S. Senate's passage of the GENIUS Act represents a
significant milestone for the cryptocurrency industry. The bipartisan
legislation establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins backed by
Treasury bills and high-quality liquid assets.
Despite
current weakness, several factors support potential recovery scenarios. The
cryptocurrency market has historically demonstrated resilience following
geopolitical shocks, and institutional adoption continues to grow.

    Read this Term legislation could accelerate mainstream adoption by enabling
traditional companies to incorporate cryptocurrency payment systems. This
regulatory clarity represents a structural positive for the industry's
long-term prospects.
However,
near-term volatility is likely to persist as markets navigate ongoing
geopolitical tensions and central bank policy decisions. The Federal Reserve's
upcoming policy meeting and continued Middle East developments will be key
catalysts for market direction.

Geopolitical heat in the Middle East is melting crypto prices. 
Bitcoin has fallen 3% to about $105,000 since the conflict between Israel and Iran started on June 13, according to CoinGecko. Ethereum plunged 8% to around $2,500 and nearly $200 billion was erased from the crypto market in the past six days. 
Markets are reeling after US President Donald Trump hinted that the US could soon intervene in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Just last week, Israel launched a series of airstrikes in retaliation for attacks by Iran-backed militants.
“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding,” Trump posted on social media, referring to Iranian head of state Ali Khamenei. “Our patience is wearing thin.”
That political brinkmanship has sent tremors through capital markets. US stocks slipped, oil prices jumped, and gold plunged. 
Risk assets like stocks and crypto tend to fall — at least initially — when war breaks out because investors flee uncertainty. Armed conflict rattles global supply chains, can destabilise economies, and trigger inflation, especially if oil prices spike. Iran produces about 3.3 million barrels of oil daily, which is about 4% of global production. 
And in crypto, the impact of Trump’s latest warning was immediate and severe. Coinbase stock fell 4%, Strategy about 3%, and Circle — which went public last week, offering up a triple-digit jackpot for investors — plunged nearly 3%. They have since slightly recovered.
Odds of a US military strike on Iran before August soared to 70% on Polymarket.
To be sure, the longer term implications of a global conflict on Bitcoin’s price remain unclear. In fact, the top crypto tends to rebound after geopolitical shocks. 
In 2022, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, both Bitcoin and gold underperformed. According to Bitcoin analyst James Check, Bitcoin plunged 40% while gold lost 5% in the first year following Russia’s attack. 
“I should note that the US Federal Reserve was aggressively raising interest rates, and most markets were in a bear market,” Check wrote in his Monday newsletter, Checkonchain. 
Following Hamas’s October 7 attacks against Israel in 2023, gold and Bitcoin spiked. The precious metal appreciated 38% while Bitcoin gained 70%. 
“The Bitcoin ETFs launched a few months after the conflict, and gold was experiencing a major bid from global central banks,” said Check. 
For Check, there might be more at play than rising tensions in the Middle East. 
Still, eyes are on the skies in Tehran and Tel Aviv.

There is an old saying, ""Once is a chance, twice is a coincidence, and a third time is a trend.""
It applies to bitcoin BTC$102,496.90 right now. The cryptocurrency's price has fallen back to its 50-day simple moving average (SMA), which offered support on two occasions this month, leading to price bounces.
Therefore, the latest re-test of the average presents an opportunity for the bulls to establish a trend in which the 50-day SMA powers new legs higher. Conversely, the fall of the 50-day SMA support could invite stronger selling pressure, potentially leading to a dip below $100,000.
At press time, the bear case appears strong due to signs of bull fatigue, as evident from the recent shallow bounces from the 50-day SMA. The first test of the average on June 5 produced a bounce from roughly $100,500 to over $10,000. However, the second test of the SMA on June 17 saw prices bounce only from $103,000 to $109,000.
The past week's Doji candle also suggests bull fatigue above $100,000.
A high-volume move above $110,000 is needed to restore the immediate bullish outlook.
Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP XRP$2.08 is trading at the lower end of the Ichimoku cloud, a momentum indicator based on several moving average variants and developed by a Japanese journalist in the 1960s.
Crossovers above and below the cloud are said to represent bullish and bearish shifts in momentum.
When an asset's price crosses below the cloud, as dogecoin DOGE$0.15803 did early this month, it typically signals a bearish trend. Traders often interpret this as a signal to consider selling or shorting the asset, especially if other macro or technical indicators confirm the signal.
XRP's 50-day SMA has already crossed below the 200-day SMA to confirm the so-called death cross, a bearish indicator. Therefore, a potential move below the Ichimoku cloud could prove costly for the bears, potentially opening the door for a slide below $2.
On the charts, support is seen directly at $ 1.60, the early April low. Coins like DOGE, ADA, and LINK have dropped below their respective Ichimoku clouds in recent days, resulting in price losses.

Bitcoin price has retreated in the past few days, and the futures market points to more downside, potentially to $100,000.
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped to $104,650 on Wednesday, June 18, marking a 6.52% decline from its highest level this year. Option traders are increasingly betting on further declines. Data from Deribit shows that the put-to-call volume ratio rose to 2.17, indicating that more traders are buying put options as a hedge.
A put option gives investors the right, but not the obligation, to sell an asset at a specific price within a defined time period. In this case, for contracts expiring on Friday, open interest in put options is concentrated at the $100,000 strike.
Investors remain cautious amid the escalating crisis in the Middle East. In a statement on Tuesday, Donald Trump suggested the U.S. may enter the conflict and potentially target Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
The conflict could fuel inflation in the U.S. and globally. Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude prices rose to $76 and $74, respectively, while global shipping costs have also jumped. As a result, the Federal Open Market Committee may opt for a wait-and-see approach, monitoring the impact of geopolitical tensions and Trump’s proposed tariffs.
On a more positive note, Bitcoin demand appears to be rising. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw over $216 million in inflows on Tuesday, bringing total cumulative inflows to $46.26 billion. In a note, an XBTO analyst said:
“A hawkish signal from the Federal Reserve could strengthen the US dollar and trigger a test of the psychological $100,000 mark. The geopolitical situation remains a wildcard, where further deterioration would likely trigger another move down across risk assets.”
On the eight-hour chart, BTC has pulled back from a high of $110,500 to around $104,530. It has formed a double-top pattern with a neckline at $100,300, a formation often associated with bearish breakouts.
Bitcoin has also fallen below the 50-period Exponential Moving Average and is approaching the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. Meanwhile, the MACD indicator has dropped below the zero line.
As such, Bitcoin may continue falling, with the next level to watch being $100,300, about 4.2% below current prices. A break below that support could open the door to a deeper decline toward the 38.2% retracement level at $97,560.

Bitcoin (BTC) price falls to around $106,000 at the time of writing on Tuesday following a mild recovery the previous day. The decline comes as investors continue to digest the escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict and after US President Donald Trump highlighted concerns and asked his security advisors to meet in the situation room. While institutional interest in Bitcoin remains robust, any further escalation in the Middle East could impact global risk assets.
Bitcoin price action remained broadly resilient on Monday despite escalating tensions in the Middle East. The four-day-old war between Israel and Iran that started on Friday had failed to trigger a sharp correction. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization held above its key psychological threshold of 100,000 despite the initial shock, compared to April last year, when BTC fell more than 8% amid similar Iran-Israel turmoil.  
The New York Times reported on Monday that US President Donald Trump has encouraged Vice President JD Vance and his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to offer to meet with the Iranians this week. 
Moreover, President Donald Trump has instructed his national security team to be ready in the White House's situation room as he travels back to Washington on Monday evening after cutting short his trip to the G7 summit, according to ABC News.
The White House stated that Trump was departing the summit early, citing the situation in the Middle East. In a post in Truth.Social on Tuesday, Trump said that he hasn't reached Iran for peace talks ""in any way.""
The Kobeissi letter reports that the meeting would be a “make or break moment” for whether the US will join the war against Iran. 


Analysts see the US bunker-buster bombs that could be used to destroy Iranian uranium enrichment facilities could serve as an “inflection point” in this ongoing conflict. 
Traders should still remain cautious, as any further escalation of ongoing tensions could disrupt stability in global risk markets. Additionally, the Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz (which is used for global Oil shipments) could also spark a surge in Oil prices, fueling further escalation or direct US military involvement. 
Bitcoin’s institutional demand remains robust, supporting its price at the start of the week. Strategy announced on Monday that it has added 10,100 BTC for $1.05 billion at an average price of $104,080 per BTC. The firm currently holds 592,100 BTC. 

Following the footsteps of the Strategy, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet announced on the same day that it had purchased an additional 1,112 BTC, bringing its total holding to 10,000 BTC.
According to Coinglass data, US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded an inflow of $408.60 million on Monday, continuing its six-day streak of gains since last week.

Bitcoin price declined sharply, falling from the June 10 open of $110,274 to the June 11 close of $105,671, creating a Fair Value Gap (FVG) at approximately $108,064. This bearish FVG  marks a key resistance zone, meaning that once Bitcoin collects liquidity, it is likely to continue its correction. 
On Monday, BTC retested and faced a slight pullback from this FGV zone, closing the day up by 1.14%. At the time of writing on Tuesday, it trades slightly down at around $106,000.
If BTC continues its correction, it could extend the decline to retest its key support at $103,070, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).  A successful close below this level could extend the decline to retest its key, psychologically important level at $100,000.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum indicator on the daily chart is hovering around its neutral level of 50, indicating indecision among traders. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator on the daily chart displayed a bearish crossover on Thursday, providing a sell signal and giving credence to the downward trend.

On the contrary, if BTC recovers and closes above its FVG level at $108,064, it could extend the recovery toward retesting its May 22 all-time high of $111,980.
Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.
Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 
Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

The adoption of cryptocurrency-related financial products, including tokenized treasuries, is on overdrive globally, with the focus now shifting to robust networks such as Ripple's XRP Ledger (XRPL).
Sei extends gains above $0.21, decoupling the token from the broader crypto market amid low sentiment and macroeconomic uncertainty. The Wyoming Stable Token Commission selects Sei Network as a candidate blockchain for the WYST, the first fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a US state.
Bitcoin bulls step up, pushing the price above $106,000, as Trump said he would delay his decision about launching strikes on Iran for up to two weeks. Ethereum rebounds from the 200-day EMA support at $2,477 amid steady interest in the derivatives market.
Solana experiences a minor uptick of under 1% at press time on Friday, with multiple long shadow candles forming above $140 as bearish momentum fades off. The optimism surrounding Solana is on the rise, as evidenced by the SOL Open Interest reaching a weekly high.
Bitcoin (BTC) price remains steady above a key support level, trading slightly above $106,000 at the time of writing on Friday. The uncertainty looms as geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel show no sign yet of an exit strategy from either side.

Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies retreated on Tuesday as geopolitical risks intensified ahead of the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision.
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped from this week’s high of $108,915 to an intraday low of $105,500. Ethereum (ETH) retreated by over 2.2%, while the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies declined to $3.28 trillion.
Additional data shows that crypto liquidations surged by 25% in the past 24 hours to over $359 million. Some of the top laggards were coins like SPX6900 (SPX), Immutable (IMX), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), Pepe (PEPE), and Worldcoin (WLD).
The ongoing sell-off in the crypto industry mirrored that of the stock market, as the Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100 indices fell by 165 and 100 points, respectively.
Bitcoin and crypto prices fell amid growing fears of a wider war in the Middle East rose. These concerns intensified after Donald Trump urged residents of Tehran to evacuate, signaling that he anticipates further bombing in the coming days.
Fears also escalated after two oil tankers collided and caught fire near the Strait of Hormuz, a critical chokepoint for millions of barrels of oil daily. As a result, crude oil prices rebounded, with Brent and West Texas Intermediate gaining over 2.2%.
The rising concerns about the crisis in the Middle East is a big reversal from Monday’s optimism that pushed crypto prices higher. The optimism was because of media reports that Iran was seeking talks to end the conflict.
The escalating crisis is impacting Bitcoin, altcoins, and other risk assets due to its effects on crude oil and inflation.
Crude oil and shipping costs have already jumped in the past few days. Data shows that the World Container Index rose to $3,543, its highest point since January.
Higher energy and transportation costs contribute to rising inflation, which could prevent the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates as Donald Trump has requested. Historically, crypto prices tend to perform better when the Fed is cutting rates or signaling future cuts.
Still, history shows that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies often rebound after major geopolitical or macroeconomic shocks. For instance, in March 2020, Bitcoin plunged from over $10,000 to below $4,000 after COVID was declared a pandemic, only to rally to a record high later that year.
Most recently, Bitcoin dropped to $74,457 in April after the Liberation Day speech and then bounced back to a new record high in May. Bitcoin is also seen as a safe-haven asset, with BlackRock data showing that it outperforms stocks after major events.

The market move came as President Donald Trump suggested that the U.S. could soon get involved in the conflict between Israel and Iran.
“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding,” Trump posted on social media, referring to Iranian head of state Ali Khamenei. “He is an easy target, but he is safe there - we are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don’t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.”
Trump also called for Iran to surrender unconditionally, and for residents of Tehran to evacuate the city. The national security council was convened, according to the White House, and Trump himself cut short a G7 summit to focus on the issue.
Odds of U.S. military action against Iran before July have soared to 65% on Polymarket.
“The sudden and severe escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict introduced a significant geopolitical risk premium, prompting an immediate flight from risk assets across the board, to which crypto has not proven immune,” said Javier Rodriguez-Alarcón, Chief Investment Officer at XBTO.
“The geopolitical situation remains a wildcard; any credible de-escalation in the Middle East could serve as a significant risk-on catalyst, while a further deterioration would likely trigger another move down across risk assets,” he added.
Matteo Greco, senior analyst at Finequia, shared the same sentiment, adding that the war could end up having significant consequences on the U.S. economic outlook. “Should Israeli military actions impact Iran’s oil production, a spike in oil prices could follow, fueling renewed inflationary pressures,” Greco said.

Bitcoin (BTC) price falls to around $106,000 at the time of writing on Tuesday following a mild recovery the previous day. The decline comes as investors continue to digest the escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict and after US President Donald Trump highlighted concerns and asked his security advisors to meet in the situation room. While institutional interest in Bitcoin remains robust, any further escalation in the Middle East could impact global risk assets.
Bitcoin price action remained broadly resilient on Monday despite escalating tensions in the Middle East. The four-day-old war between Israel and Iran that started on Friday had failed to trigger a sharp correction. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization held above its key psychological threshold of 100,000 despite the initial shock, compared to April last year, when BTC fell more than 8% amid similar Iran-Israel turmoil.  
The New York Times reported on Monday that US President Donald Trump has encouraged Vice President JD Vance and his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to offer to meet with the Iranians this week. 
Moreover, President Donald Trump has instructed his national security team to be ready in the White House's situation room as he travels back to Washington on Monday evening after cutting short his trip to the G7 summit, according to ABC News.
The White House stated that Trump was departing the summit early, citing the situation in the Middle East. In a post in Truth.Social on Tuesday, Trump said that he hasn't reached Iran for peace talks ""in any way.""
The Kobeissi letter reports that the meeting would be a “make or break moment” for whether the US will join the war against Iran. 


Analysts see the US bunker-buster bombs that could be used to destroy Iranian uranium enrichment facilities could serve as an “inflection point” in this ongoing conflict. 
Traders should still remain cautious, as any further escalation of ongoing tensions could disrupt stability in global risk markets. Additionally, the Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz (which is used for global Oil shipments) could also spark a surge in Oil prices, fueling further escalation or direct US military involvement. 
Bitcoin’s institutional demand remains robust, supporting its price at the start of the week. Strategy announced on Monday that it has added 10,100 BTC for $1.05 billion at an average price of $104,080 per BTC. The firm currently holds 592,100 BTC. 

Following the footsteps of the Strategy, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet announced on the same day that it had purchased an additional 1,112 BTC, bringing its total holding to 10,000 BTC.
According to Coinglass data, US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded an inflow of $408.60 million on Monday, continuing its six-day streak of gains since last week.

Bitcoin price declined sharply, falling from the June 10 open of $110,274 to the June 11 close of $105,671, creating a Fair Value Gap (FVG) at approximately $108,064. This bearish FVG  marks a key resistance zone, meaning that once Bitcoin collects liquidity, it is likely to continue its correction. 
On Monday, BTC retested and faced a slight pullback from this FGV zone, closing the day up by 1.14%. At the time of writing on Tuesday, it trades slightly down at around $106,000.
If BTC continues its correction, it could extend the decline to retest its key support at $103,070, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).  A successful close below this level could extend the decline to retest its key, psychologically important level at $100,000.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum indicator on the daily chart is hovering around its neutral level of 50, indicating indecision among traders. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator on the daily chart displayed a bearish crossover on Thursday, providing a sell signal and giving credence to the downward trend.

On the contrary, if BTC recovers and closes above its FVG level at $108,064, it could extend the recovery toward retesting its May 22 all-time high of $111,980.
Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.
Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 
Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

The adoption of cryptocurrency-related financial products, including tokenized treasuries, is on overdrive globally, with the focus now shifting to robust networks such as Ripple's XRP Ledger (XRPL).
Sei extends gains above $0.21, decoupling the token from the broader crypto market amid low sentiment and macroeconomic uncertainty. The Wyoming Stable Token Commission selects Sei Network as a candidate blockchain for the WYST, the first fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a US state.
Bitcoin bulls step up, pushing the price above $106,000, as Trump said he would delay his decision about launching strikes on Iran for up to two weeks. Ethereum rebounds from the 200-day EMA support at $2,477 amid steady interest in the derivatives market.
Solana experiences a minor uptick of under 1% at press time on Friday, with multiple long shadow candles forming above $140 as bearish momentum fades off. The optimism surrounding Solana is on the rise, as evidenced by the SOL Open Interest reaching a weekly high.
Bitcoin (BTC) price remains steady above a key support level, trading slightly above $106,000 at the time of writing on Friday. The uncertainty looms as geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel show no sign yet of an exit strategy from either side.

Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies retreated on Tuesday as geopolitical risks intensified ahead of the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision.
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped from this week’s high of $108,915 to an intraday low of $105,500. Ethereum (ETH) retreated by over 2.2%, while the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies declined to $3.28 trillion.
Additional data shows that crypto liquidations surged by 25% in the past 24 hours to over $359 million. Some of the top laggards were coins like SPX6900 (SPX), Immutable (IMX), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), Pepe (PEPE), and Worldcoin (WLD).
The ongoing sell-off in the crypto industry mirrored that of the stock market, as the Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100 indices fell by 165 and 100 points, respectively.
Bitcoin and crypto prices fell amid growing fears of a wider war in the Middle East rose. These concerns intensified after Donald Trump urged residents of Tehran to evacuate, signaling that he anticipates further bombing in the coming days.
Fears also escalated after two oil tankers collided and caught fire near the Strait of Hormuz, a critical chokepoint for millions of barrels of oil daily. As a result, crude oil prices rebounded, with Brent and West Texas Intermediate gaining over 2.2%.
The rising concerns about the crisis in the Middle East is a big reversal from Monday’s optimism that pushed crypto prices higher. The optimism was because of media reports that Iran was seeking talks to end the conflict.
The escalating crisis is impacting Bitcoin, altcoins, and other risk assets due to its effects on crude oil and inflation.
Crude oil and shipping costs have already jumped in the past few days. Data shows that the World Container Index rose to $3,543, its highest point since January.
Higher energy and transportation costs contribute to rising inflation, which could prevent the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates as Donald Trump has requested. Historically, crypto prices tend to perform better when the Fed is cutting rates or signaling future cuts.
Still, history shows that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies often rebound after major geopolitical or macroeconomic shocks. For instance, in March 2020, Bitcoin plunged from over $10,000 to below $4,000 after COVID was declared a pandemic, only to rally to a record high later that year.
Most recently, Bitcoin dropped to $74,457 in April after the Liberation Day speech and then bounced back to a new record high in May. Bitcoin is also seen as a safe-haven asset, with BlackRock data showing that it outperforms stocks after major events.

Bitcoin BTC$102,982.16 is down 3.8% in the last 24 hours, trading under $104,000 yet again. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, exchange coins and memecoins — lost 6.1% in the same period of time, with ether ETH$2,398.32 and solana SOL$138.64 both slumping 7% and sui SUI$2.61 dipping almost 10%.
Crypto stocks are also taking a hit, with Coinbase (COIN), Strategy (MSTR) and Circle (CRLC) all down 2%-3%, and bitcoin miners such as Bitdeer (BTDR), Riot Platforms (RIOT), CleanSpark (CLSK), HIVE (HIVE) and Hut 8 (HUT) losing 6%-7%.
The market move came as President Donald Trump suggested that the U.S. could soon get involved in the conflict between Israel and Iran.
“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding,” Trump posted on social media, referring to Iranian head of state Ali Khamenei. “He is an easy target, but he is safe there - we are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don’t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.”
Trump also called for Iran to surrender unconditionally, and for residents of Tehran to evacuate the city. The national security council was convened, according to the White House, and Trump himself cut short a G7 summit to focus on the issue.
Odds of U.S. military action against Iran before July have soared to 65% on Polymarket.
“The sudden and severe escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict introduced a significant geopolitical risk premium, prompting an immediate flight from risk assets across the board, to which crypto has not proven immune,” said Javier Rodriguez-Alarcón, Chief Investment Officer at XBTO.
“The geopolitical situation remains a wildcard; any credible de-escalation in the Middle East could serve as a significant risk-on catalyst, while a further deterioration would likely trigger another move down across risk assets,” he added.
Matteo Greco, senior analyst at Finequia, shared the same sentiment, adding that the war could end up having significant consequences on the U.S. economic outlook. “Should Israeli military actions impact Iran’s oil production, a spike in oil prices could follow, fueling renewed inflationary pressures,” Greco said.

There are thousands of crypto coins, from bitcoin and ethereum to litecoin and solana. Just the sheer number of available cryptos can seem overwhelming when you’re new to investing.
The top 10 cryptocurrencies listed below hold a utility or store-of-value thesis and a market cap greater than $5 billion. Cryptos with at least $5 billion in market cap are typically more stable, with greater institutional adoption.
Market Cap: $22.06 billion
7-Day Change: -10.91%
Price News: As of 9:59 a.m. ET, the price of cardano, or 1 ADA, traded at $0.62. Cardano’s highest 52-week intraday price was $1.32 on Dec. 2, 2024.
Cardano: Cardano is a next-generation blockchain platform that aims to improve the limitations of earlier blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum. ADA pioneered proof-of-stake validation to reduce environmental impact and supports smart contracts and dApps like ethereum.
Cardano’s ADA token has had relatively modest growth compared to other major crypto coins. In 2017, ADA’s price hovered around In 2017, ADA’s price hovered $0.02. As of June 17, 2025, its price traded at $0.62, an increase of 2,778%.
Pros:
Cons:
Market Dominance: 0.67%
Market Cap: $92.01 billion
7-Day Change: -1.52%
Price News: BNB, or 1 BNB, traded at $653.06, as of 9:59 a.m. ET. The highest intraday price that BNB reached in the past year was $793.35 on Dec. 4, 2024.
BNB: Originally launched to pay trading fees on the Binance exchange, BNB has grown into a utility token used for transactions, payments and dApps within the Binance ecosystem.
As an added perk, users can get a discount on trading fees when using BNB on a Binance crypto exchange. But there’s also the utility aspect. The token can be used to pay transaction fees on the BNB Smart Chain, which supports smart contracts and dApps.
From $0.12 in July 2017 to $653.06 on June 17, 2025, BNB has soared by 566,780%.
Pros:
Cons:
Market Dominance: 2.80%
Market Cap: $2.10 trillion
7-Day Change: -3.56%
Price News: Bitcoin stood at $105,428.58 per coin as of 9:59 a.m. ET, with its annual high being $111,970.17 on May 22, 2025.
Bitcoin: Created in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin is the original and most recognized cryptocurrency.
The “OG” of crypto runs on a decentralized blockchain network. The network uses an energy-intensive, proof-of-work consensus system. On the network, miners validate transactions on the chain by solving complex puzzles. For each validated block, miners earn a reward of 3.125 BTC per block, currently worth $329,464.33.
The proof-of-work consensus model is often criticized for its carbon footprint. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that crypto mining, which bitcoin uses, represents up to 2.3% of U.S. electricity consumption. BTC has risen from roughly $0.06 in July 2010 to around $105,428.58 as of June 17, 2025, with a staggering increase of 170,426,819%.
Pros:
Cons:
Market Dominance: 63.89%
Market Cap: $5.97 billion
7-Day Change: -11.25%
Price News: Polkadot’s price was $3.76 at 9:59 a.m. ET. Its highest point in the past year came on Dec. 4, 2024, when it hit $11.60.
Polkadot: Launched by ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood in 2020, polkadot is designed to unify previously siloed blockchains.
Polkadot’s network facilitates the transfer of tokens and data between major chains like ethereum and bitcoin. At the core of polkadot are parachains; these are customizable, independent blockchains that offload processing demand while leveraging polkadot’s security infrastructure.
Polkadot’s price when it launched in August 2020 was $2.79. Today it trades at $3.76 for a gain of 35%.
Pros:
Cons:
Market Dominance: 0.18%
Market Cap: $308.59 billion
7-Day Change: -6.84%
Price News: Ethereum traded at $2,556.22 as of 9:59 a.m. ET. The highest price in the last 12 months was $4,106.96, reached on Dec. 16, 2024.
Ethereum: Ethereum harnesses a powerful blockchain platform for building decentralized applications, known as dApps. This crypto was the brainchild of Vitalik Buterin, created to apply blockchain technology to programmability.
So, how is ethereum used in the programming world? Well, developers use ethereum for smart contracts. These are self-executing agreements coded directly onto the blockchain. There are many use cases for dApps, as they can be applied to finance, supply chain management and more.
Ether is the native coin on the network. Developers use ETH to pay “gas” fees. These fees compensate network validators for their computational work in completing transactions and smart contracts. From $2.83 in August 2015 to about $2,556.22 as of June 17, 2025, ETH has grown by 90,174%.
Pros:
Cons:
Market Dominance: 9.41%
Market Cap: $6.50 billion
7-Day Change: -6.35%
Price News: Litecoin traded at $85.59 as of 9:58 a.m. ET. Its yearly high was $146.61 on Dec. 5, 2024.
Litecoin: Launched in 2011 by former Google engineer Charlie Lee, litecoin is often referred to as “digital silver” to bitcoin’s “digital gold.” Built on bitcoin’s source code, litecoin offers faster block times at 2.5 minutes per block compared to bitcoin’s 10 minutes. Like bitcoin, litecoin uses a proof-of-work consensus and undergoes halving events. It’s worth mentioning that LTC has a capped supply of 84 million coins. Currently, there are 76.0 million LTC in circulation.
LTC is up 1,890% since its launch in April 2013.
Pros:
Cons:
Market Dominance: 0.20%
Market Cap: $79.05 billion
7-Day Change: -5.82%
Price News: At 9:59 a.m. ET, 1 SOL was priced at $149.75. The highest price that solana hit last year was $294.33 on Jan. 19, 2025.
Solana: Solana is designed for speed and scalability, using a hybrid proof-of-stake and proof-of-history system to process thousands of transactions per second.
SOL is recovering developer and user activity despite its well-known network outages of the past. Fans of solana will believe it’s a good alternative to ethereum, rivaling its competitor in terms of speed and cost factors.
Since its launch in 2020, Solana has risen to $149.75 as of June 17, 2025, for a gain of 67,970%.
Pros:
Cons:
Market Dominance: 2.41%
Market Cap: $26.47 billion
7-Day Change: -4.91%
Price News: As of 9:58 a.m. ET, 1 TRX was worth $0.28. Its highest value in the past year occurred on Dec. 3, 2024, hitting $0.44.
TRON: Tron originally launched in 2017 on the ethereum token network until it moved to its own chain. Its proof-of-stake consensus makes it energy efficient, while TRX, its native token, fuels transactions and smart contracts.
One of the original premises of the crypto was to help original content creators receive income for their work. The platform supports smart contracts and dApps.
TRX has grown from $0.0019 in 2017 to about $0.28 as of June 17, 2025.
Pros:
Cons:
Market dominance: 0.81%
Market Cap: $130.52 billion
7-Day Change: -3.31%
Price News: XRP’s market price stood at $2.22 as of 9:59 a.m. ET, with a 12-month high of $3.39 set on Jan. 16, 2025.
XRP: XRP was created by Ripple Labs to facilitate fast and low-cost, cross-border payments. It acts as a bridge between currencies, enabling instant transfers with minimal fees.
Unlike bitcoin and other mined cryptos, XRP tokens enter circulation whenever Ripple chooses to sell coins. For that reason, there are concerns over the centralized nature that controls XRP’s supply. XRP hit $2.22 on June 17, 2025, up 37,637% since August 2013.
Pros:
Cons:
Market dominance: 3.98%
Market Cap: $23.24 billion

Price News: Lido Staked ETH was priced at $2,554.64 at 9:59 a.m. ET, with its highest intraday level over the past year being $4,092 on Dec. 16, 2024.
Lido Staked ETH: It’s true to its name of being a token with a skated ETH value. StETH allows ethereum holders to earn staking rewards while keeping their assets liquid. One of the drawbacks of “normal” ethereum staking is you need 32 ETH ($81,799) to stake and it has varying lock-up periods. According to Coinbase Exchange, lock-up periods range from a few hours to a few days.
The perk of StETH is accruing staking rewards and liquidity on DeFi platforms. But StETH’s large share of staked ETH has raised concerns about decentralization. That said, stETH remains a popular option for crypto investors seeking passive income. StETH has grown from $594 in December 2020 to about $2,554.64 as of June 17, 2025. The token attempts to mirror ETH’s price.

Cons:
Market dominance: <0.01%
We filtered cryptocurrencies by utility or store of value, alongside trading momentum and other metrics, such as seven-day performance and 24-hour trading volume.
Our momentum screen for the best cryptos to buy or watch right now in the table below is ordered by 24-hour volume. These cryptos are not stablecoins, which are pegged to stable assets, nor are they wrapped (tokenized versions that run on nonnative blockchains) or liquid staking coins, which are given in return for staking.
If you’re new to buying crypto, especially altcoins (anything other than bitcoin), it’s important to research and invest carefully. The screen we’ve built helps highlight cryptos with momentum. But it’s still up to you to look into each one and decide whether it makes sense for your risk tolerance and investment goals.
Nic Puckrin, analyst and founder of The Coin Bureau, an educational platform for all things cryptocurrency and blockchain, highlights, “Bitcoin is the gold standard, the ‘risk-off’ crypto, while altcoins are much more volatile and risky.”
To determine our list of top cryptocurrencies, we applied a series of screeners designed to highlight assets that demonstrate both market momentum and a credible underlying thesis. Our methodology focuses exclusively on cryptocurrencies with an investment thesis. These are projects whose value is expected to appreciate over time as adoption and utility grow.
We used market capitalization as a primary screening tool. Bitcoin and ethereum, widely recognized as the “gold and silver” of crypto, currently hold the largest market caps, at $2.1 trillion and $308.6 billion, respectively, together accounting for approximately 73% of the total cryptocurrency market.
But our focus extends beyond the top two. To capture promising but relatively stable projects, we looked at crypto assets in the midcap to large-cap range. Given crypto’s higher volatility, we chose a more conservative cutoff: screening only for projects with a market cap of at least $5 billion.
We evaluated whether a cryptocurrency has shown positive performance over the past seven days with high 24-hour trade volumes. These metrics help us to identify assets with current investor interest and potential growth.
We considered the fundamental purpose of each crypto asset. For example, bitcoin is widely recognized as a store of value, whereas ethereum serves as a platform for decentralized applications, including smart contracts and NFTs. For that reason, we excluded:

Cryptocurrencies are various forms of digital money that are usually based on blockchain technology. Blockchain technology allows most cryptocurrencies to exist as “trustless” forms of transactions. This means there is no centralized authority overseeing the transactions on a cryptocurrency’s blockchain.
Cryptocurrency is an emerging area with more than 17,000 crypto coins in existence as of June 2025, according to Coingecko.
While some cryptos function as currencies, others are used to develop infrastructure. For instance, in the case of ethereum or solana, developers are building other cryptos on top of these platform currencies, and that creates even more possibilities and cryptos.
When choosing the best cryptocurrency to invest in, it is important to consider your individual goals, investment timeline, and risk profile, just as you would with any investment. Additionally, you should do your due diligence to make sure that any crypto project you are interested in is legitimate and secure.
In general, investors should consider the following when evaluating crypto:
Investors should focus on cryptocurrencies that “solve problems, have strong infrastructure or legal positioning, and are building with the next wave of adoption in mind,” says Pablo Gerboles Parrilla, founding director of Alive DevOps, a software development company.
Most crypto experts, whether they work on crypto education or blockchains or are the CEO of a crypto wallet company, will tell you not to jump on the latest “hot” crypto trend, especially when it comes to meme coins.
“Most meme coin investments are quick pump-and-dump schemes, so even experienced investors get burned. Instead, go for blue-chip cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin or solana, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. If you want to experiment with altcoins, treat them as a small experimental addition to your portfolio and diversify,” Puckrin advises.
You can buy cryptocurrencies through crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase, Binance or Gemini. In addition, some brokerages, such as Webull and Robinhood, also allow consumers to buy cryptocurrencies.
How much it costs to buy cryptocurrency depends on several factors, including which crypto you are buying. Many small altcoins trade for a fraction of a cent, while a single bitcoin will cost you $105,429. However, many brokerages and exchanges now allow fractional trading, offering investors the option to buy a portion of a cryptocurrency.
There are also often costs and fees associated with having a crypto wallet and/or an account on a brokerage or crypto exchange. Be sure that you understand all of the costs associated with buying and holding any cryptocurrency before you invest.
Part of what makes bitcoin so valuable is its scarcity as its maximum supply is limited to 21 million coins.
“Bitcoin’s value lies in its decentralization, scarcity and censorship-resistance. It can’t be controlled by any corporation or individual, which was the whole point of it. It was designed as a response to the 2008 financial crisis,” Puckrin says.
Currently, there are 19.9 million coins in circulation, as of June 17, 2025. To create supply, bitcoin rewards crypto miners with a set amount. To be exact, 3.125 BTC is issued when a miner has successfully mined a single block.
To keep the process in check, the rewards given for mining bitcoin are cut in half almost every four years. The last bitcoin halving event occurred in April 2024, when mining a block of bitcoin fell from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC.
The limit of 21 million bitcoins is expected to be reached in 2040.
While you can invest in cryptocurrencies, they differ a great deal from traditional investments, like stocks. When you buy stock, you are buying a share of ownership of a company, which means you’re entitled to do things like vote on the direction of the company. If that company goes bankrupt, you may also receive some compensation once its creditors have been paid from its liquidated assets.
Buying cryptocurrency doesn’t grant you ownership over anything except the token itself; it’s more like exchanging one form of currency for another. If the crypto loses its value, you won’t receive anything after the fact.
There are several other key differences to keep in mind:
While the initial premise of cryptocurrency was to fix the problems with traditional currencies, there are now a whole host of utility cryptocurrencies that have sprung up, thanks to the creation of the blockchain.

Bitcoin (BTC) price falls to around $106,000 at the time of writing on Tuesday following a mild recovery the previous day. The decline comes as investors continue to digest the escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict and after US President Donald Trump highlighted concerns and asked his security advisors to meet in the situation room. While institutional interest in Bitcoin remains robust, any further escalation in the Middle East could impact global risk assets.
Bitcoin price action remained broadly resilient on Monday despite escalating tensions in the Middle East. The four-day-old war between Israel and Iran that started on Friday had failed to trigger a sharp correction. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization held above its key psychological threshold of 100,000 despite the initial shock, compared to April last year, when BTC fell more than 8% amid similar Iran-Israel turmoil.  
The New York Times reported on Monday that US President Donald Trump has encouraged Vice President JD Vance and his Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to offer to meet with the Iranians this week. 
Moreover, President Donald Trump has instructed his national security team to be ready in the White House's situation room as he travels back to Washington on Monday evening after cutting short his trip to the G7 summit, according to ABC News.
The White House stated that Trump was departing the summit early, citing the situation in the Middle East. In a post in Truth.Social on Tuesday, Trump said that he hasn't reached Iran for peace talks ""in any way.""
The Kobeissi letter reports that the meeting would be a “make or break moment” for whether the US will join the war against Iran. 


Analysts see the US bunker-buster bombs that could be used to destroy Iranian uranium enrichment facilities could serve as an “inflection point” in this ongoing conflict. 
Traders should still remain cautious, as any further escalation of ongoing tensions could disrupt stability in global risk markets. Additionally, the Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz (which is used for global Oil shipments) could also spark a surge in Oil prices, fueling further escalation or direct US military involvement. 
Bitcoin’s institutional demand remains robust, supporting its price at the start of the week. Strategy announced on Monday that it has added 10,100 BTC for $1.05 billion at an average price of $104,080 per BTC. The firm currently holds 592,100 BTC. 

Following the footsteps of the Strategy, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet announced on the same day that it had purchased an additional 1,112 BTC, bringing its total holding to 10,000 BTC.
According to Coinglass data, US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded an inflow of $408.60 million on Monday, continuing its six-day streak of gains since last week.

Bitcoin price declined sharply, falling from the June 10 open of $110,274 to the June 11 close of $105,671, creating a Fair Value Gap (FVG) at approximately $108,064. This bearish FVG  marks a key resistance zone, meaning that once Bitcoin collects liquidity, it is likely to continue its correction. 
On Monday, BTC retested and faced a slight pullback from this FGV zone, closing the day up by 1.14%. At the time of writing on Tuesday, it trades slightly down at around $106,000.
If BTC continues its correction, it could extend the decline to retest its key support at $103,070, the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA).  A successful close below this level could extend the decline to retest its key, psychologically important level at $100,000.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) momentum indicator on the daily chart is hovering around its neutral level of 50, indicating indecision among traders. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator on the daily chart displayed a bearish crossover on Thursday, providing a sell signal and giving credence to the downward trend.

On the contrary, if BTC recovers and closes above its FVG level at $108,064, it could extend the recovery toward retesting its May 22 all-time high of $111,980.
Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.
Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.
Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility. 
Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin’s interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

The adoption of cryptocurrency-related financial products, including tokenized treasuries, is on overdrive globally, with the focus now shifting to robust networks such as Ripple's XRP Ledger (XRPL).
Sei extends gains above $0.21, decoupling the token from the broader crypto market amid low sentiment and macroeconomic uncertainty. The Wyoming Stable Token Commission selects Sei Network as a candidate blockchain for the WYST, the first fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a US state.
Bitcoin bulls step up, pushing the price above $106,000, as Trump said he would delay his decision about launching strikes on Iran for up to two weeks. Ethereum rebounds from the 200-day EMA support at $2,477 amid steady interest in the derivatives market.
Solana experiences a minor uptick of under 1% at press time on Friday, with multiple long shadow candles forming above $140 as bearish momentum fades off. The optimism surrounding Solana is on the rise, as evidenced by the SOL Open Interest reaching a weekly high.
Bitcoin (BTC) price remains steady above a key support level, trading slightly above $106,000 at the time of writing on Friday. The uncertainty looms as geopolitical tensions between Iran and Israel show no sign yet of an exit strategy from either side.

Bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies retreated on Tuesday as geopolitical risks intensified ahead of the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision.
Bitcoin (BTC) dropped from this week’s high of $108,915 to an intraday low of $105,500. Ethereum (ETH) retreated by over 2.2%, while the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies declined to $3.28 trillion.
Additional data shows that crypto liquidations surged by 25% in the past 24 hours to over $359 million. Some of the top laggards were coins like SPX6900 (SPX), Immutable (IMX), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), Pepe (PEPE), and Worldcoin (WLD).
The ongoing sell-off in the crypto industry mirrored that of the stock market, as the Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100 indices fell by 165 and 100 points, respectively.
Bitcoin and crypto prices fell amid growing fears of a wider war in the Middle East rose. These concerns intensified after Donald Trump urged residents of Tehran to evacuate, signaling that he anticipates further bombing in the coming days.
Fears also escalated after two oil tankers collided and caught fire near the Strait of Hormuz, a critical chokepoint for millions of barrels of oil daily. As a result, crude oil prices rebounded, with Brent and West Texas Intermediate gaining over 2.2%.
The rising concerns about the crisis in the Middle East is a big reversal from Monday’s optimism that pushed crypto prices higher. The optimism was because of media reports that Iran was seeking talks to end the conflict.
The escalating crisis is impacting Bitcoin, altcoins, and other risk assets due to its effects on crude oil and inflation.
Crude oil and shipping costs have already jumped in the past few days. Data shows that the World Container Index rose to $3,543, its highest point since January.
Higher energy and transportation costs contribute to rising inflation, which could prevent the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates as Donald Trump has requested. Historically, crypto prices tend to perform better when the Fed is cutting rates or signaling future cuts.
Still, history shows that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies often rebound after major geopolitical or macroeconomic shocks. For instance, in March 2020, Bitcoin plunged from over $10,000 to below $4,000 after COVID was declared a pandemic, only to rally to a record high later that year.
Most recently, Bitcoin dropped to $74,457 in April after the Liberation Day speech and then bounced back to a new record high in May. Bitcoin is also seen as a safe-haven asset, with BlackRock data showing that it outperforms stocks after major events.

A key indicator suggests that bitcoin's BTC$103,135.92 price could soon become more volatile, possibly leading to the next leg higher in the cryptocurrency.
This indicator is based on the gap between the bollinger bands, which are volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-week simple moving average of the cryptocurrency's price.
When the gap widens, it indicates that the market is more active and volatile – a phenomenon historically observed ahead of significant upward moves in BTC. When the gap narrows, it indicates less activity.
The gap, also known as the bollinger band spread, could soon widen in a positive sign for the bulls, as the MACD histogram linked to the same gap has turned positive.
Using the spread between the bollinger bands as input in the MACD histogram generates bullish or bearish volatility signals, identifying periods of turbulence and calm. Traders typically use the indicator to detect trend reversals in prices.
The upper pane displays bitcoin's weekly open, high, low, and close (per UTC) in candlestick format. The middle pane displays the spread, or the gap between the bollinger bands, with the MACD linked to the spread in the lower pane.
The MACD has now flipped positive, indicating a renewed widening of the spread or volatility boom ahead. By default, volatility is price-agnostic, meaning an impending activity could be bullish or bearish.
That said, a closer look at the above chart reveals that previous positive crossovers of the MACD (marked by vertical lines) presaged major bull runs, including the late 2020 and late 2024 price rallies.
Let's see if history repeats itself.

Bitcoin BTC$103,110.88 has risen 3.1% in the last 24 hours and is now trading for $108,600, only a couple of thousand dollars below its all-time record. It certainly wasn’t alone in its ascension. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, memecoins and exchange coins — is up 4.3% in the same period of time, buoyed by strong performances from XRP$2.10 and chainlink LINK$12.42, which both notched 6-7% gains, and most other tokens rising at least 3%.
A check at traditional markets shows that risk appetite has returned after last week's jitters on Israel and Iran launching missiles. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq indexes bounced 0.9% and 1.4%, while safe haven gold declined 1.5%.
Crypto stocks also joined the surge. Coinbase (COIN) and Circle (CRCL) closed the day 7.7% and 13% in the green. Among bitcoin miners, Bitdeer (BTDR) and Hut 8 (HUT) gained 6.9% and 5.6% respectively. Remarkably, one of the only equities in the red was Strategy (MSTR), which lost almost 0.2%, while rival bitcoin treasury companies Metaplanet rose 25% on the Japanese stock market.
Positive crypto-related news added further fuel to today's rally: JPMorgan has filed a trademark application for a product that seeks to offer digital asset services such as trading, exchange, payment services and issuance. Meanwhile, asset manager Purpose is set to launch its spot XRP exchange-traded fund in Canada as momentum for altcoin-focused ETFs grows.
While today's altcoin outperformance may have inspired some traders' hope for an imminent alt season, Nansen research analyst Nicolai Søndergaard poured cold water on such expectations.
It's still bitcoin that's leading the market, he said, with strength often tracing back to the largest crypto's performance.
""BTC has mostly served as a trigger for altcoins,"" Søndergaard. ""Some alts also do well. BTC breaks an ATH? The market likes that."" Some profits from BTC's rise to fresh record high may have trickled down to other cryptos, while some sectors such as DeFi have enjoyed short-term bursts of outperformance.
""These have, however, not been prolonged runs for alts, and looking at the grand scheme of things, most alts have been bleeding for some time,"" he said. The focus is still very much on BTC.""
Bitcoin's strong rebound from Friday's low could bode well for the crypto market.
Bitfinex analysts noted that the sentiment index Fear and Greed Index dropped into “Fear” territory last week, while Bitcoin’s Net Taker Volume showed aggressive selling.
""This behavior, combined with a spike in liquidations, resembles past capitulation-style setups that often mark local bottoms,” the analysts said. ""If BTC can hold the $102,000-$103,000 zone, it may suggest that selling pressure is being absorbed and that the market could be primed for recovery.""
From a macro lens, attention is squarely on the Federal Reserve and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference.
Investors overwhelmingly expect the Fed to keep benchmark rates steady this week and the following meeting in July, according to the CME FedWatch tool, market participants will focus on Powell's remarks about clues on how policymakers navigate inflation and job market pressures.
""Powell’s tone, not the rate decision, will drive volatility,"" digital asset analytics firm Swissblock said in a Monday note. ""Expect whiplash trading across commodities, yields and risk assets.""

A key indicator suggests that bitcoin's BTC$103,059.65 price could soon become more volatile, possibly leading to the next leg higher in the cryptocurrency.
This indicator is based on the gap between the bollinger bands, which are volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-week simple moving average of the cryptocurrency's price.
When the gap widens, it indicates that the market is more active and volatile – a phenomenon historically observed ahead of significant upward moves in BTC. When the gap narrows, it indicates less activity.
The gap, also known as the bollinger band spread, could soon widen in a positive sign for the bulls, as the MACD histogram linked to the same gap has turned positive.
Using the spread between the bollinger bands as input in the MACD histogram generates bullish or bearish volatility signals, identifying periods of turbulence and calm. Traders typically use the indicator to detect trend reversals in prices.
The upper pane displays bitcoin's weekly open, high, low, and close (per UTC) in candlestick format. The middle pane displays the spread, or the gap between the bollinger bands, with the MACD linked to the spread in the lower pane.
The MACD has now flipped positive, indicating a renewed widening of the spread or volatility boom ahead. By default, volatility is price-agnostic, meaning an impending activity could be bullish or bearish.
That said, a closer look at the above chart reveals that previous positive crossovers of the MACD (marked by vertical lines) presaged major bull runs, including the late 2020 and late 2024 price rallies.
Let's see if history repeats itself.

A key indicator suggests that bitcoin's BTC$102,550.26 price could soon become more volatile, possibly leading to the next leg higher in the cryptocurrency.
This indicator is based on the gap between the bollinger bands, which are volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-week simple moving average of the cryptocurrency's price.
When the gap widens, it indicates that the market is more active and volatile – a phenomenon historically observed ahead of significant upward moves in BTC. When the gap narrows, it indicates less activity.
The gap, also known as the bollinger band spread, could soon widen in a positive sign for the bulls, as the MACD histogram linked to the same gap has turned positive.
Using the spread between the bollinger bands as input in the MACD histogram generates bullish or bearish volatility signals, identifying periods of turbulence and calm. Traders typically use the indicator to detect trend reversals in prices.
The upper pane displays bitcoin's weekly open, high, low, and close (per UTC) in candlestick format. The middle pane displays the spread, or the gap between the bollinger bands, with the MACD linked to the spread in the lower pane.
The MACD has now flipped positive, indicating a renewed widening of the spread or volatility boom ahead. By default, volatility is price-agnostic, meaning an impending activity could be bullish or bearish.
That said, a closer look at the above chart reveals that previous positive crossovers of the MACD (marked by vertical lines) presaged major bull runs, including the late 2020 and late 2024 price rallies.
Let's see if history repeats itself.

Bitcoin BTC$102,476.84 has risen 3.1% in the last 24 hours and is now trading for $108,600, only a couple of thousand dollars below its all-time record. It certainly wasn’t alone in its ascension. The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, memecoins and exchange coins — is up 4.3% in the same period of time, buoyed by strong performances from XRP$2.08 and chainlink LINK$12.29, which both notched 6-7% gains, and most other tokens rising at least 3%.
A check at traditional markets shows that risk appetite has returned after last week's jitters on Israel and Iran launching missiles. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq indexes bounced 0.9% and 1.4%, while safe haven gold declined 1.5%.
Crypto stocks also joined the surge. Coinbase (COIN) and Circle (CRCL) closed the day 7.7% and 13% in the green. Among bitcoin miners, Bitdeer (BTDR) and Hut 8 (HUT) gained 6.9% and 5.6% respectively. Remarkably, one of the only equities in the red was Strategy (MSTR), which lost almost 0.2%, while rival bitcoin treasury companies Metaplanet rose 25% on the Japanese stock market.
Positive crypto-related news added further fuel to today's rally: JPMorgan has filed a trademark application for a product that seeks to offer digital asset services such as trading, exchange, payment services and issuance. Meanwhile, asset manager Purpose is set to launch its spot XRP exchange-traded fund in Canada as momentum for altcoin-focused ETFs grows.
While today's altcoin outperformance may have inspired some traders' hope for an imminent alt season, Nansen research analyst Nicolai Søndergaard poured cold water on such expectations.
It's still bitcoin that's leading the market, he said, with strength often tracing back to the largest crypto's performance.
""BTC has mostly served as a trigger for altcoins,"" Søndergaard. ""Some alts also do well. BTC breaks an ATH? The market likes that."" Some profits from BTC's rise to fresh record high may have trickled down to other cryptos, while some sectors such as DeFi have enjoyed short-term bursts of outperformance.
""These have, however, not been prolonged runs for alts, and looking at the grand scheme of things, most alts have been bleeding for some time,"" he said. The focus is still very much on BTC.""
Bitcoin's strong rebound from Friday's low could bode well for the crypto market.
Bitfinex analysts noted that the sentiment index Fear and Greed Index dropped into “Fear” territory last week, while Bitcoin’s Net Taker Volume showed aggressive selling.
""This behavior, combined with a spike in liquidations, resembles past capitulation-style setups that often mark local bottoms,” the analysts said. ""If BTC can hold the $102,000-$103,000 zone, it may suggest that selling pressure is being absorbed and that the market could be primed for recovery.""
From a macro lens, attention is squarely on the Federal Reserve and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference.
Investors overwhelmingly expect the Fed to keep benchmark rates steady this week and the following meeting in July, according to the CME FedWatch tool, market participants will focus on Powell's remarks about clues on how policymakers navigate inflation and job market pressures.
""Powell’s tone, not the rate decision, will drive volatility,"" digital asset analytics firm Swissblock said in a Monday note. ""Expect whiplash trading across commodities, yields and risk assets.""
Tom writes about markets, bitcoin mining and crypto adoption in Latin America. He has a bachelor's degree in English literature from McGill University, and can usually be found in Costa Rica. He holds BTC above CoinDesk's disclosure threshold of $1,000.
Krisztian Sandor is a U.S. markets reporter focusing on stablecoins, tokenization, real-world assets. He graduated from New York University's business and economic reporting program before joining CoinDesk. He holds BTC, SOL and ETH.

 The legacy cryptocurrency moved as high as $110,400 Wednesday morning after a closely watched inflation report showed that consumer prices rose less than expected last month, good news for investors who are hoping the Federal Reserve could be in a position to cut its benchmark interest rate this year. The price of bitcoin dropped to $108,800 recently, as U.S. stocks backed off their earlier highs as well.

 Once a fringe financial asset dismissed by the mainstream, cryptocurrencies have gained new legitimacy this year thanks in part to the support of President Donald Trump and several allies in Congress. The price of bitcoin has also been supported by surging demand from publicly traded companies, such as Strategy (MSTR), that use proceeds from equity sales to purchase bitcoin for corporate treasuries. Meanwhile, total assets in bitcoin exchange traded funds have ballooned to $132 billion this month, up from $91 billion in early April, pointing to growing institutional interest in the cryptocurrency.

 Bitcoin last hit a record high, of just under $112,000, on May 22. The digital currency has gained about 16% since the start of the year, far outpacing the performance of major stock indexes.

 Below, we take a closer look at Bitcoin’s chart and apply technical analysis to identify key price levels worth watching out for.

 After hitting its all-time high last month, bitcoin’s price consolidated within a flag, a chart pattern that indicates a continuation of the cryptocurrency's uptrend that started in early April.

 Indeed, the digital asset staged a decisive breakout above the pattern earlier this week, laying the groundwork for a new move higher. Meanwhile, the relative strength index confirms bullish price momentum, though the indicator remains below overbought levels, providing ample room for further upside.

 In another win for bitcoin bulls, the 50-day moving average (MA) crossed above the 200-day MA last month to form a bullish golden cross signal.

 Let’s identify two key overhead areas to watch amid the potential for further buying and also locate support levels worth monitoring during profit-taking periods.

 The first overhead area to watch sits around $112,000. This area on the chart will likely attract significant scrutiny near last month’s peak.

 A move higher could see bitcoin rally toward $137,000. We projected this target by extracting the price bars comprising the cryptocurrency’s uptrend that preceded the flag and repositioning them from the pattern’s breakout area.

 We selected this prior trend as it commenced following a breakout from a pennant pattern in late April, providing clues as to how the current breakout from a period of consolidation may unfold.

 During profit-taking, investors should initially monitor the $107,000 level. A retest of the prominent December and January peaks may be necessary before the cryptocurrency makes a meaningful move higher.

 Finally, a deeper retracement could see bitcoin’s price revisit the closely-watched $100,000 level. This area would likely provide support near the psychological round number and a trendline that connects a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to last November.

Bitcoin surged to a record high on Thursday, vaulting more than 3% in early trading and hurtling past $110,000 for the first time.
The price of bitcoin stood at $111,385 on Thursday, extending a sharp rise that stretches back to the November election of President Donald Trump, a cryptocurrency supporter and investor.
Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, jumped 6%. The $TRUMP memecoin, a crypto coin launched by the president in January, increased nearly 6%.
A surge in the value of some cryptocurrencies in recent days followed a Senate vote to advance the GENIUS Act, an industry-backed bill that aims to regulate some digital currency.
The measure establishes rules targeting stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to the value of another asset, often the U.S. dollar.
If enacted, the bill could allow such crypto coins to become a mainstream tool for digital payments and other financial instruments, setting the stage for an influx of investment in digital currency.
Critics say the measure fails to address conflict-of-interest concerns exemplified by Trump, and it risks endangering consumers and the wider economy with a weak set of restrictions.
Trump, who also backs a cryptocurrency firm World Liberty Financial, has denied any wrongdoing involving his crypto ventures.
The record high for bitcoin also coincides with a spike in Treasury yields amid deficit concerns centered on a domestic policy bill passed by the U.S. House on Thursday.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday found the tax policies backed by Trump would add $3.8 trillion to the national debt. The finding comes days after a U.S. credit downgrade at Moody's in part due to the country’s deficit.
Higher yields increase the cost of U.S. borrowing and add strain to the nation’s finances. In theory, investors may seek out alternatives to the U.S. dollar as debt yields face upward pressure.
Bryan Armour, the director of passive strategies research at financial firm Morningstar, attributed the recent rise in the price of bitcoin to both industry regulation and bond market fears.
“​​I suspect it’s a mix of regulatory adoption and fear for the dollar given the expectation of high government spending,” Armour said.
The price of bitcoin has surged about 40% since the presidential election. Over that period, the S&P 500 has declined 2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has dropped 3%.
In July, Trump told the audience at a cryptocurrency conference in Nashville, Tennessee, that he wanted to turn the U.S. into the ""crypto capital of the planet.""
Trump promised to weaken federal oversight of cryptocurrency and establish the federal government's first strategic bitcoin reserve.
In March, Trump signed an executive order establishing the reserve of digital currencies, saying the move would position the U.S. “as a leader among nations in government digital asset strategy.”
On Thursday, Trump is set to attend a gala with hundreds of top investors in his memecoin, which an announcement described as an “intimate private dinner.”
The move elicited concern among some critics as a possible means of exchanging access to the president for financial gain.

Talk about timing. 
Less than 24 hours before President Donald Trump was set to host a gala for crypto investors, the price of bitcoin hit an all-time high — a confluence of events likely to bolster Trump's reputation as a champion of digital assets even as the dinner has raised ethical concerns. 
Around 12 p.m. Thursday, bitcoin's price had settled at about $111,300. It hit an all-time high of $$111,875 at approximately 3:30 a.m., the crypto publication CoinDesk reported. 
Trump is scheduled to preside over a dinner at his property outside Washington, D.C., on Thursday that will convene the top recent holders of his $TRUMP coin cryptocurrency. 
More than 200 mostly anonymous crypto buyers, many of them from overseas, spent a total of $394 million on the so-called memecoin, with purchases ranging from $55,000 to $37.7 million, according to the blockchain analytics company Nansen. 
The gala has been in the works for months — part of Trump's push to both reward and continue to curry favor with the crypto crowd. It's a group that gave millions to the president's campaign and ended up as the largest single donor bloc during the 2024 electoral contest. 
While some bitcoin backers have been left disappointed by the lack of commitment to purchasing the token on the open market as a means of backing a strategic reserve, Trump has reined in the aggressive regulatory enforcement of the crypto industry that was a hallmark of the Biden administration.    
Yet even some longtime bitcoin investors were caught by surprise when Trump announced his $TRUMP coin on the eve of his inauguration. Even as its price has declined following an initial surge, Trump and his family pocketed millions from the coins' sales.   
Critics have decried the memecoin dinner as raising conflicts of interest, foreign-influence concerns and even constitutional issues. The top buyer, Justin Sun, is a Chinese national previously sought by U.S. law enforcement officials. 
Trump has sidestepped these complaints. While $TRUMP coin is overseen by Trump's private corporate organization, White House officials said in an earlier statement to NBC News, ""The President is working to secure GOOD deals for the American people, not for himself"" through events like the dinner, and that he ""only acts in the best interests of the American public.""
That appears to include an ongoing focus on the crypto sector.  It comes as bitcoin's price has surged amid renewed fears about the global economy and a worldwide government borrowing glut and subsequent sell-off in bonds.
For some, it's made alternative assets like bitcoin more attractive.     
Yet even as the token's price scales new heights, there remains debate about whether it can truly serve as an effective hedge against broader market volatility.
With a handful of exceptional episodes, bitcoin's price has in recent years tended to track those of other tech stocks — but with even wider price swings. It's also been tightly correlated with Federal Reserve interest rate decisions: When the Fed has cut rates, bitcoin's price has surged. When they've sought to keep rates higher, its price has declined. 
These trends have run counter to the narrative pushed by some bitcoin backers that the cryptocurrency can serve as a hedge against inflation or an alternative to the U.S. dollar. 
But the latest surge in bitcoin's price has come even as many tech stocks and the broader S&P 500 have declined. Some of the lift has been bolstered by the passage of the GENIUS Act, which is designed to give official government approval to the issuance of privately backed digital tokens that help crypto exchanges process transactions.  
While the bill is ostensibly tailored to address these so-called stablecoins, any increase in the pool of buyers naturally serves to support bitcoin's price — and give renewed hope that the digital token can achieve a kind of escape velocity against almost any economic backdrop. 
""It's not going away, it’s going to be part of a lot of portfolios, even if it's just 2-3%,"" said Wedbush Securities finance group managing director Dan Ives. ""It’s still a risky asset, but the deregulatory environment has changed the way people view crypto as an investment.""
